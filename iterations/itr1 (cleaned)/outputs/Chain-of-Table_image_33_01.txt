1. The matrix \( A \) is given as \( \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \), which is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix. 
2. (a) The null space of \( A \), \( \text{Nul }A \), is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) because the null space consists of all solutions \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) to \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), so \( k = 2 \) for part (a). 
3. (b) The column space of \( A \), \( \text{Col }A \), is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \) because the columns of \( A \) are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so \( k = 4 \) for part (b).
