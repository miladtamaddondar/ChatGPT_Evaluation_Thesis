1. To find \( h \) such that the eigenspace for \( \lambda = 5 \) is two-dimensional, we first compute \( A - 5I \): \( A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix} \).  
2. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of \( A - 5I \), so we need the nullity to be 2, which means the rank must be 2 (since the matrix is 4x4 and nullity + rank = 4).  
3. Row reduce \( A - 5I \): The last two rows are \( [0,0,0,4] \) and \( [0,0,0,-4] \), which are linearly dependent, so only one contributes to the rank.  
4. The first two rows are \( [0,-2,6,-1] \) and \( [0,-2,h,0] \); subtract the second from the first to get \( [0,0,6-h,-1] \).  
5. If \( 6-h \neq 0 \), then the first two rows are linearly independent, and together with the third row, the rank is 3, so the nullity is 1 (not enough).  
6. Set \( 6-h = 0 \) so \( h = 6 \), then the first two rows become \( [0,-2,6,-1] \) and \( [0,-2,6,0] \), which are linearly dependent (subtracting gives \( [0,0,0,-1] \)), so only one is independent.  
7. Now, the independent rows are: one from the first two, and one from the last two, so the rank is 2, and the nullity is 2.  
8. Therefore, the value of \( h \) such that the eigenspace for \( \lambda = 5 \) is two-dimensional is \( \boxed{6} \).
