1. Form the matrix \(A\) whose columns are the given vectors: \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\); this step is correct as the span of the vectors is the column space of \(A\).
2. To find a basis, we row reduce \(A\) to echelon form to identify linearly independent columns; this is justified since the pivot columns correspond to a basis for the column space.
3. Perform row operations: \(R_2 \leftarrow R_2 + 3R_1\), \(R_3 \leftarrow R_3 - 2R_1\), \(R_4 \leftarrow R_4 + 4R_1\), yielding \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & -6 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as each operation preserves the row space.
4. Next, \(R_4 \leftarrow R_4 + \frac{6}{5}R_3\) gives \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as we are eliminating below-pivot entries.
5. The leading entries (pivots) are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so the corresponding original vectors \(\mathbf{v}_1\), \(\mathbf{v}_3\), and \(\mathbf{v}_4\) form a basis; this follows from the theory of pivot columns.
6. The dimension of the subspace is 3, since there are 3 linearly independent vectors in the basis; this is justified by the number of pivot columns.
7. Final answer: A basis is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\), and the dimension is 3.
