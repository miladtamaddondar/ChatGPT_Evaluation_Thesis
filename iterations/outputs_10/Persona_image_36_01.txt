1. The matrix \( A \) has 4 rows and 6 columns, so it is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix.
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1's in row echelon form) is 3, as seen in columns 1, 3, and 4.
3. The dimension of the column space (Col \(A\)) is the number of pivot columns, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).
4. The dimension of the null space (Nul \(A\)) is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the number of pivots: \(6 - 3 = 3\).
5. Final answer: \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\), \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\).
