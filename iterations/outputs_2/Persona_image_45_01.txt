1. The dot product \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}\) is calculated as \(2 \times (-7) + (-5) \times (-4) + (-1) \times 6 = -14 + 20 - 6 = 0\).  
2. The squared norm \(\|\mathbf{u}\|^2\) is calculated as \(2^2 + (-5)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 25 + 1 = 30\).  
3. The squared norm \(\|\mathbf{v}\|^2\) is calculated as \((-7)^2 + (-4)^2 + 6^2 = 49 + 16 + 36 = 101\).  
4. The sum \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\) is \(\begin{bmatrix}2 + (-7) \\ -5 + (-4) \\ -1 + 6\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-5 \\ -9 \\ 5\end{bmatrix}\).  
5. The squared norm \(\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2\) is \((-5)^2 + (-9)^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 81 + 25 = 131\).  
6. Comparing the results: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\), \(\|\mathbf{u}\|^2 = 30\), \(\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 101\), and \(\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = 131\).
