1. The matrix $A$ has $4$ rows and $2$ columns, so $A$ is a $4 \times 2$ matrix.  
2. The null space $\text{Nul }A$ consists of all solutions $x$ to $Ax = 0$, where $x$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$, so $\text{Nul }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and thus $k = 2$.  
3. The column space $\text{Col }A$ is the span of the columns of $A$, which are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$, so $\text{Col }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$ and thus $k = 4$.
