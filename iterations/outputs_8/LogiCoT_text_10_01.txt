1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( \begin{bmatrix}1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct since the echelon form has zeros below each leading entry.
2. To find a basis for \( \text{Col } A \), identify the pivot columns in the echelon form, which are columns 1, 3, and 4; this is correct because those columns contain the leading entries.
3. The basis for \( \text{Col } A \) is formed by taking columns 1, 3, and 4 of the original matrix \( A \): \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7\end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct by the definition of the column space basis.
4. To find a basis for \( \text{Nul } A \), write the homogeneous system \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \) using the echelon form: \( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \), \( 5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \), \( 5x_4 = 0 \); this is correct since each row corresponds to an equation.
5. From the last equation, \( x_4 = 0 \); substituting into the second equation gives \( 5x_3 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0 \); this is correct by back substitution.
6. Substitute \( x_3 = 0 \) and \( x_4 = 0 \) into the first equation to get \( x_1 - 3x_2 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2 \); this is correct algebraic manipulation.
7. Let \( x_2 = t \), then the general solution is \( \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}3t \\ t \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} = t\begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \), so the basis for \( \text{Nul } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct since it spans the null space.
8. The dimension of \( \text{Col } A \) is 3 (number of pivot columns), and the dimension of \( \text{Nul } A \) is 1 (number of free variables); this is correct by the rank-nullity theorem.
9. Final answer: Basis for \( \text{Col } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7\end{bmatrix} \right\} \), basis for \( \text{Nul } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\} \), dimensions are 3 and 1, respectively.
