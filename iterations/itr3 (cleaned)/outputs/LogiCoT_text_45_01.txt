1. Compute the dot product $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}$: $(2)(-7) + (-5)(-4) + (-1)(6) = -14 + 20 - 6 = 0$; by the definition of the dot product, this is correct.  
2. Compute $\|\mathbf{u}\|^2$: $(2)^2 + (-5)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 25 + 1 = 30$; by the definition of the norm squared, this is correct.  
3. Compute $\|\mathbf{v}\|^2$: $(-7)^2 + (-4)^2 + (6)^2 = 49 + 16 + 36 = 101$; by the definition of the norm squared, this is correct.  
4. Compute $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$: $\begin{bmatrix} 2 + (-7) \\ -5 + (-4) \\ -1 + 6 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -5 \\ -9 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$; by vector addition, this is correct.  
5. Compute $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2$: $(-5)^2 + (-9)^2 + (5)^2 = 25 + 81 + 25 = 131$; by the definition of the norm squared, this is correct.  
6. Compare the results: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$, $\|\mathbf{u}\|^2 = 30$, $\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 101$, $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = 131$; since $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$, $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal, and $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2$ as expected by the Pythagorean theorem.
