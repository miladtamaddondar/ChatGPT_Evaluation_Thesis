1. The matrix \(A\) is a \(4 \times 6\) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. The dimension of \(\text{Col } A\) (the column space) is the rank of \(A\), which is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in its row echelon form.  
3. Observing the given matrix, there are 3 nonzero rows with leading 1's (in columns 1, 3, and 4), so \(\text{rank}(A) = 3\).  
4. The dimension of \(\text{Nul } A\) (the null space) is given by the number of free variables, which is the total number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\).  
5. Final answers: 5. \(\dim(\text{Col } A) = 3\), \(\dim(\text{Nul } A) = 3\).
