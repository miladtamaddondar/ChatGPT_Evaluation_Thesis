1. Identify the set \( W \) as all vectors of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix} \) where \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \). 2. Check if \( W \) is closed under addition by adding two arbitrary elements: \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a_1 + b_1 \\ 4 \\ a_1 - 5b_1 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 3a_2 + b_2 \\ 4 \\ a_2 - 5b_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3(a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2) \\ 8 \\ (a_1 + a_2) - 5(b_1 + b_2) \end{bmatrix} \). 3. Observe that the second component of the sum is 8, not 4, so the sum is not of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix} \), violating closure under addition. 4. Conclude that \( W \) is not a vector space because it is not closed under addition.
