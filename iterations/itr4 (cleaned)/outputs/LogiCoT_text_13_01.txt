1. To find a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\), we solve \((A - 4I)\vec{x} = \vec{0}\); first compute \(A - 4I\): \[A - 4I = \begin{bmatrix}3-4 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3-4 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1-4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4-4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]; this is correct by subtracting 4 from each diagonal entry.
2. Set up the homogeneous system \((A-4I)\vec{x} = \vec{0}\), i.e., \(\begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as it matches the definition of the eigenspace.
3. Write out the system of equations: \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = 0\), \(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 0\), \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\), and \(0 = 0\); this is correct as it matches the matrix multiplication.
4. From the third equation, \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0 \implies x_2 = 3x_3\); this is correct by isolating \(x_2\).
5. Substitute \(x_2 = 3x_3\) into the second equation: \(x_1 - (3x_3) + x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 - 2x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 = 2x_3\); this is correct by combining like terms.
6. Substitute \(x_1 = 2x_3\) into the first equation: \(-2x_3 + 2x_3 = 0\), which is always true; this verifies consistency.
7. The variable \(x_4\) does not appear in any equation, so it is free; this is correct since the last column and row are zeros except for the diagonal.
8. The general solution is \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2x_3 \\ 3x_3 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = x_3\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} + x_4\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct by expressing the solution in terms of free variables.
9. Therefore, a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct as these vectors are linearly independent and span the eigenspace.
