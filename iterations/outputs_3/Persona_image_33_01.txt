1. To solve part (a), recall that the null space (Nul \(A\)) of a matrix \(A\) with \(n\) columns is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), so we need to find the number of columns in \(A\). 
2. The matrix \(A\) is given as \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\), which has 2 columns, so \(k = 2\) for part (a). 
3. For part (b), recall that the column space (Col \(A\)) of a matrix \(A\) with \(m\) rows is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), so we need to find the number of rows in \(A\). 
4. The matrix \(A\) has 4 rows, so \(k = 4\) for part (b). 
5. Final answers: (a) \(k = 2\), (b) \(k = 4\).
