1. The matrix $A$ has $4$ rows and $6$ columns, so $A$ is a $4 \times 6$ matrix.  
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1's in each row) in $A$ is $3$ (columns 1, 3, and 4).  
3. The dimension of $\text{Col }A$ is the number of pivot columns, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.  
4. The dimension of $\text{Nul }A$ is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the number of pivot columns: $6 - 3 = 3$, so $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$.
