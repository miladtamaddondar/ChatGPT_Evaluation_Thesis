1. The matrix $A$ has $4$ rows and $6$ columns, so its size is $4 \times 6$.
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1s in each row) is $3$ (columns $1$, $3$, and $4$).
3. The dimension of $\text{Col }A$ is the number of pivot columns, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.
4. The dimension of $\text{Nul }A$ is the number of free variables, which is $6 - 3 = 3$.
5. Final answer: $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$ and $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$.
