1. To find a basis for the subspace spanned by the vectors, we first form a matrix with the vectors as columns: \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\).  
2. We perform row reduction (Gaussian elimination) to determine the linear independence of the columns; start with the first column as the pivot and eliminate below: Row 2 = Row 2 + 3*Row 1, Row 3 = Row 3 - 2*Row 1, Row 4 = Row 4 + 4*Row 1, yielding \(A' = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & -6 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\).  
3. Next, use Row 3 to eliminate below and above: Row 4 = Row 4 + (6/5)*Row 3, giving \(A'' = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\).  
4. Now, back substitute to see which columns are pivots: Column 1 (row 1), column 3 (row 2), and column 4 (row 3) have leading entries, so columns 1, 3, and 4 are linearly independent.  
5. Check if column 2 is a linear combination of the others: Since there is no pivot in column 2, it is dependent on the others and can be omitted from the basis.  
6. Therefore, a basis for the subspace is \(\left\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \right\}\).  
7. The dimension of the subspace is the number of basis vectors, so the dimension is \(3\).
