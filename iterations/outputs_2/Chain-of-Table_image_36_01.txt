1. The matrix \( A \) is already in row echelon form, so we can count the number of pivot columns (columns with leading 1s) to find the rank. 
2. There are 3 nonzero rows, so the rank of \( A \) is 3. 
3. The dimension of Col \( A \) (the column space) is equal to the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\). 
4. The dimension of Nul \( A \) (the null space) is the number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\), so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\). 
5. Final answer: \(\boxed{\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3, \quad \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3}\).
