1. The matrix \( A \) has 4 rows and 6 columns, so it is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix.
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1's in each row) is 3, as seen in columns 1, 3, and 4.
3. The dimension of Col \( A \) (the column space) is the rank, which is the number of pivot columns: \( \dim(\text{Col } A) = 3 \).
4. The dimension of Nul \( A \) (the null space) is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the rank: \( \dim(\text{Nul } A) = 6 - 3 = 3 \).
5. Final answer: \( \dim(\text{Col } A) = 3 \) and \( \dim(\text{Nul } A) = 3 \).
