1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1's in reduced row echelon form) is 3, as seen in columns 1, 3, and 4.  
3. By the rank theorem, the rank of \( A \) (dimension of Col \( A \)) is 3.  
4. The dimension of Nul \( A \) is the number of columns minus the rank: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).  
5. Final answer: The dimension of Col \( A \) is 3 and the dimension of Nul \( A \) is 3.
