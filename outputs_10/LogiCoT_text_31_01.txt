1. Identify the general form of vectors in $W$: Any vector in $W$ is of the form $\begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4a - 5b \end{bmatrix}$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.  
2. Express the general vector as a linear combination: $\begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4a - 5b \end{bmatrix} = a\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} + b\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix}$.  
3. Verify that $W$ is closed under addition: Let $u = \begin{bmatrix} 3a_1 + b_1 \\ 4a_1 - 5b_1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $v = \begin{bmatrix} 3a_2 + b_2 \\ 4a_2 - 5b_2 \end{bmatrix}$, then $u+v = \begin{bmatrix} 3(a_1+a_2) + (b_1+b_2) \\ 4(a_1+a_2) - 5(b_1+b_2) \end{bmatrix}$, which is of the same form as elements of $W$, so $W$ is closed under addition.  
4. Verify that $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication: For scalar $k$, $k\begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4a - 5b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3(ka) + (kb) \\ 4(ka) - 5(kb) \end{bmatrix}$, which is of the same form as elements of $W$, so $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.  
5. Conclude $W$ is a vector space because it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication and contains the zero vector (set $a=0, b=0$).  
6. Identify a spanning set: Since every vector in $W$ can be written as a linear combination of $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix}$, $S = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix} \right\}$ spans $W$.  
7. Verify that the spanning set is valid: The determinant of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 4 & -5 \end{bmatrix}$ is $3 \cdot (-5) - 1 \cdot 4 = -15 - 4 = -19 \neq 0$, so the vectors are linearly independent and span a 2-dimensional subspace, which is all of $\mathbb{R}^2$.  
8. Final answer: $S = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix} \right\}$ is a set of vectors that spans $W$, and $W = \mathbb{R}^2$.
