1. Identify the size of matrix $A$; $A$ is a $4 \times 2$ matrix because it has 4 rows and 2 columns.  
2. The null space $\text{Nul }A$ consists of all solutions $x$ to $A x = 0$, where $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$ since $A$ has 2 columns.  
3. By definition, $\text{Nul }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ because the domain of the transformation $x \mapsto Ax$ is $\mathbb{R}^2$.  
4. The column space $\text{Col }A$ is the span of the columns of $A$, which are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$ since $A$ has 4 rows.  
5. By definition, $\text{Col }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$ because the codomain of the transformation $x \mapsto Ax$ is $\mathbb{R}^4$.  
6. Therefore, for part (a), $k = 2$ for $\text{Nul }A$ and for part (b), $k = 4$ for $\text{Col }A$.
