1. The matrix \(A\) is given as \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\).
2. (a) The null space Nul \(A\) consists of all vectors \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\) such that \(A x = 0\), so Nul \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\), thus \(k = 2\).
3. (b) The column space Col \(A\) consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \(A\), which are vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^4\), so Col \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\), thus \(k = 4\).
4. Final answer: (a) \(k = 2\) for Nul \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), (b) \(k = 4\) for Col \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\).
