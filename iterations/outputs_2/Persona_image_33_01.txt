1. To find \( k \) such that \(\text{Nul }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), recall that the null space of an \( m \times n \) matrix \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \(n\) is the number of columns of \(A\); since \(A\) has 2 columns, \(k = 2\).  
2. To find \( k \) such that \(\text{Col }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), recall that the column space of an \( m \times n \) matrix \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \(m\) is the number of rows of \(A\); since \(A\) has 4 rows, \(k = 4\).  
3. Final answers: (a) \(k = 2\) for \(\text{Nul }A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\); (b) \(k = 4\) for \(\text{Col }A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\).
