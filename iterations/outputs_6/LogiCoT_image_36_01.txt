1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. The dimension of Col \( A \) is the rank of \( A \), which is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in its row echelon form; here, there are 3 pivots (first, second, and third rows).  
3. Therefore, \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).  
4. The dimension of Nul \( A \) is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\).  
5. Therefore, \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\).
