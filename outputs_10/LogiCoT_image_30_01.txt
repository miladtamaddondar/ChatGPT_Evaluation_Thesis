1. Set up the system of equations by equating \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2x_2, -x_1 + 3x_2, 3x_1 - 2x_2) \) to \( (-1, 4, 9) \): \( x_1 - 2x_2 = -1 \), \( -x_1 + 3x_2 = 4 \), \( 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9 \). 2. Verify that the system is consistent by checking if the third equation is a linear combination of the first two: Multiply the first equation by 3 to get \( 3x_1 - 6x_2 = -3 \), then add the second equation to it: \( (3x_1 - 6x_2) + (-x_1 + 3x_2) = -3 + 4 \implies 2x_1 - 3x_2 = 1 \), which is not the same as the third equation, so all three equations are needed. 3. Solve the first two equations: From \( x_1 - 2x_2 = -1 \), \( x_1 = -1 + 2x_2 \); substitute into the second equation: \( -(-1 + 2x_2) + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 - 2x_2 + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 + x_2 = 4 \implies x_2 = 3 \). 4. Substitute \( x_2 = 3 \) into \( x_1 = -1 + 2x_2 \) to get \( x_1 = -1 + 2 \times 3 = -1 + 6 = 5 \). 5. Verify the solution in the third equation: \( 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 3 \times 5 - 2 \times 3 = 15 - 6 = 9 \), which matches the third component, confirming correctness. 6. Final answer: The solution is \( \mathbf{x} = (5, 3) \).
