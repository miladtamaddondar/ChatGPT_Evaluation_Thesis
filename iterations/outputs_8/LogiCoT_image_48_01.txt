1. To find a nonzero vector \(\mathbf{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) orthogonal to both \(\mathbf{u}_1\) and \(\mathbf{u}_2\), we seek \(\mathbf{v}\) such that \(\mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{u}_2 \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\).  
2. Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}\); then \(\mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v} = 1x + 1y + (-2)z = x + y - 2z = 0\).  
3. Similarly, \(\mathbf{u}_2 \cdot \mathbf{v} = 5x + (-1)y + 2z = 5x - y + 2z = 0\).  
4. We now have a system of two equations: \(x + y - 2z = 0\) and \(5x - y + 2z = 0\).  
5. Add the two equations: \((x + y - 2z) + (5x - y + 2z) = 0 \implies 6x = 0 \implies x = 0\).  
6. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the first equation: \(0 + y - 2z = 0 \implies y = 2z\).  
7. Substitute \(x = 0\) and \(y = 2z\) into the second equation: \(5(0) - (2z) + 2z = 0 \implies 0 = 0\), which is always true, confirming consistency.  
8. Thus, any vector of the form \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2z \\ z \end{bmatrix} = z \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\) is a solution, with \(z \neq 0\) for nonzero \(\mathbf{v}\).  
9. Choosing \(z = 1\), a nonzero vector orthogonal to both \(\mathbf{u}_1\) and \(\mathbf{u}_2\) is \(\boxed{\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}}\).
