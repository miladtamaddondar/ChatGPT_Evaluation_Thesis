1. The matrix $A$ is a $4 \times 6$ matrix, so it has $6$ columns and $4$ rows.  
2. To find the dimensions of $\text{Nul }A$ and $\text{Col }A$, we use the Rank-Nullity Theorem: $\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n$, where $n$ is the number of columns.  
3. The rank of $A$ is the number of pivot columns in its row echelon form; from the given matrix, the leading entries (pivots) are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so $\text{rank}(A) = 3$.  
4. The dimension of $\text{Col }A$ is equal to the rank, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.  
5. The dimension of $\text{Nul }A$ is $n - \text{rank}(A) = 6 - 3 = 3$, so $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$.  
6. Final answer: $\boxed{\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3,\ \dim(\text{Col }A) = 3}$.
