1. Compute the dot product \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}\): \(2 \times (-7) + (-5) \times (-4) + (-1) \times 6 = -14 + 20 - 6 = 0\); verified by the distributive property of dot product.  
2. Compute \(\|\mathbf{u}\|^2\): \(2^2 + (-5)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 25 + 1 = 30\); verified by the definition of the squared norm.  
3. Compute \(\|\mathbf{v}\|^2\): \((-7)^2 + (-4)^2 + 6^2 = 49 + 16 + 36 = 101\); verified by the definition of the squared norm.  
4. Compute \(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\): \(\begin{bmatrix}2\\-5\\-1\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}-7\\-4\\6\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-5\\-9\\5\end{bmatrix}\); verified by vector addition.  
5. Compute \(\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2\): \((-5)^2 + (-9)^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 81 + 25 = 131\); verified by the definition of the squared norm.  
6. Compare the results: \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\), \(\|\mathbf{u}\|^2 = 30\), \(\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 101\), \(\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = 131\); note that \(\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2\) since \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\), which is consistent with the parallelogram law for orthogonal vectors.
