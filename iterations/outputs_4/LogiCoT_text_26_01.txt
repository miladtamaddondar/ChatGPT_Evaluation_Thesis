1. To show $T$ is a linear transformation, we seek a $4 \times 4$ matrix $A$ such that $T(\vec{x}) = A\vec{x}$ for all $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T$; this is possible if $T$ is linear.  
2. Write $T(\vec{x})$ as a column vector: $T(\vec{x}) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ x_1 + x_2 \\ x_2 + x_3 \\ x_3 + x_4 \end{pmatrix}$; this matches the output format of a matrix-vector product.  
3. Express each output entry as a linear combination of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$: the first entry is $0$, the second is $x_1 + x_2$, the third is $x_2 + x_3$, and the fourth is $x_3 + x_4$.  
4. Construct the matrix $A$ row by row: the first row is $(0,0,0,0)$ (since $0 = 0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 + 0x_4$), the second is $(1,1,0,0)$, the third is $(0,1,1,0)$, and the fourth is $(0,0,1,1)$.  
5. Thus, $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$; verify by multiplying $A$ by $\vec{x}$: $A\vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ x_1 + x_2 \\ x_2 + x_3 \\ x_3 + x_4 \end{pmatrix}$, which matches $T(\vec{x})$.  
6. Therefore, $T$ is a linear transformation and is implemented by the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
