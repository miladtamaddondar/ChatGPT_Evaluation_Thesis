1. Form the matrix \(A\) with the given vectors as columns: \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\); this is valid since a basis can be found by examining the linear independence of the columns.
2. Begin row reduction to row echelon form to determine linear independence: Subtract \(-3\) times row 1 from row 2, \(-2\) times row 1 from row 3, and \(4\) times row 1 from row 4, yielding \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 11 & 23 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct by the properties of elementary row operations.
3. Continue reducing: Subtract \(11/5\) times row 2 from row 4 to eliminate the third entry in row 4, resulting in \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 38 \end{bmatrix}\); this is valid as we are creating zeros below the pivots.
4. Observe that there are 4 nonzero rows (pivots), which means the rank of the matrix is 4; thus, the original vectors are linearly independent.
5. Since all 4 vectors are linearly independent, they form a basis for the subspace they span, and the dimension of the subspace is 4.
6. Final answer: The set \(\left\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \right\}\) is a basis for the subspace, and the dimension of the subspace is 4.
