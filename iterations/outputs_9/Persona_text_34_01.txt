1. Write the vectors as columns of a matrix: \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -3 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & -4 & -3 & 1 \\ -3 & 2 & 1 & -8 & -6 \\ 2 & -3 & 6 & 7 & 9 \end{bmatrix} \).
2. Use row reduction to find the pivot columns, starting with the first column as the pivot: the first entry is already 1.
3. Eliminate the entries below the first pivot by adding 3 times row 1 to row 3 and subtracting 2 times row 1 from row 4: new row 3 is \( [0, 2, -8, 12, 0] \), new row 4 is \( [0, -3, 12, 5, 5] \).
4. Move to the second column and use row 2 as the pivot row (entry is 1); eliminate entries below by subtracting 2 times row 2 from row 3 and adding 3 times row 2 to row 4: new row 3 is \( [0, 0, -12, 18, -2] \), new row 4 is \( [0, 0, 18, -4, 8] \).
5. Move to the third column and use row 3 as the pivot row (entry is -12); eliminate entry below by adding \( \frac{18}{-12} = -1.5 \) times row 3 to row 4: new row 4 is \( [0, 0, 0, 23, 5] \).
6. The leading entries (pivots) are in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, so the first four vectors are linearly independent.
7. Therefore, a basis for the space spanned by the vectors is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ -4 \\ 1 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ -8 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\} \).
