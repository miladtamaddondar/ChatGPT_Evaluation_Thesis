1. Let $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2)$ and set up the equation $T(x_1, x_2) = (3, 8)$, which gives the system: $x_1 + x_2 = 3$ and $4x_1 + 5x_2 = 8$.  
2. Solve the first equation for $x_1$: $x_1 = 3 - x_2$.  
3. Substitute $x_1 = 3 - x_2$ into the second equation: $4(3 - x_2) + 5x_2 = 8$.  
4. Expand and simplify: $12 - 4x_2 + 5x_2 = 8$ leads to $12 + x_2 = 8$.  
5. Solve for $x_2$: $x_2 = 8 - 12 = -4$.  
6. Substitute $x_2 = -4$ back into $x_1 = 3 - x_2$ to get $x_1 = 3 - (-4) = 7$.  
7. Therefore, the solution is $\mathbf{x} = (7, -4)$.
