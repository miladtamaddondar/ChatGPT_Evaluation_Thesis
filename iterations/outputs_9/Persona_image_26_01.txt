1. To show \( T \) is a linear transformation, we need to find a matrix \( A \) such that \( T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} \) for \( \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T \).
2. Write \( T(\mathbf{x}) = (0, x_1 + x_2, x_2 + x_3, x_3 + x_4) \) as a matrix-vector product.
3. The first component is always 0, so the first row of \( A \) is \( (0, 0, 0, 0) \).
4. The second component is \( x_1 + x_2 \), so the second row of \( A \) is \( (1, 1, 0, 0) \).
5. The third component is \( x_2 + x_3 \), so the third row of \( A \) is \( (0, 1, 1, 0) \).
6. The fourth component is \( x_3 + x_4 \), so the fourth row of \( A \) is \( (0, 0, 1, 1) \).
7. Thus, the matrix is \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
8. Therefore, \( T \) is a linear transformation and is implemented by the matrix \( A \) above.
