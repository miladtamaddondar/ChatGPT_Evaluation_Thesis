1. Set up the system of equations from \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, 4x_1 + 5x_2) = (3, 8) \): \( x_1 + x_2 = 3 \) and \( 4x_1 + 5x_2 = 8 \). 2. Solve the first equation for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \). 3. Substitute \( x_1 \) into the second equation: \( 4(3 - x_2) + 5x_2 = 8 \). 4. Expand and combine like terms: \( 12 - 4x_2 + 5x_2 = 8 \) gives \( 12 + x_2 = 8 \). 5. Solve for \( x_2 \): \( x_2 = 8 - 12 = -4 \). 6. Substitute \( x_2 = -4 \) back into \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \): \( x_1 = 3 - (-4) = 7 \). 7. Verify the solution by plugging \( x_1 = 7 \), \( x_2 = -4 \) into both original equations: \( 7 + (-4) = 3 \) and \( 4(7) + 5(-4) = 28 - 20 = 8 \), both are satisfied. 8. Final answer: \( \mathbf{x} = (7, -4) \).
