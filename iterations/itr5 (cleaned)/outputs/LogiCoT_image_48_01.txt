1. To find a nonzero vector \(\mathbf{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) orthogonal to both \(\mathbf{u}_1\) and \(\mathbf{u}_2\), we seek \(\mathbf{v}\) such that \(\mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{u}_2 \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0\); this is the definition of orthogonality in terms of the dot product.  
2. Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}\); then the orthogonality conditions become: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = x + y - 2z = 0\) and \(\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = 5x - y + 2z = 0\).  
3. We now have a system of two linear equations in three variables: \(x + y - 2z = 0\) and \(5x - y + 2z = 0\); this system can be solved using linear algebraic methods such as row reduction.  
4. Add the two equations to eliminate \(y\): \((x + y - 2z) + (5x - y + 2z) = 0 + 0 \implies 6x = 0 \implies x = 0\); this step is valid as adding equations preserves the solution set.  
5. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the first equation: \(0 + y - 2z = 0 \implies y = 2z\); this is valid as substitution is a standard method for solving linear systems.  
6. Substitute \(x = 0\) and \(y = 2z\) into the second equation: \(5 \cdot 0 - (2z) + 2z = 0 \implies 0 = 0\), confirming consistency and that \(z\) is a free variable.  
7. Therefore, the general solution is \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2z \\ z \end{bmatrix} = z \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), where \(z \neq 0\) for a nonzero vector; this follows from the properties of null spaces and linear dependence.  
8. The final answer: A nonzero vector orthogonal to both \(\mathbf{u}_1\) and \(\mathbf{u}_2\) is \(\boxed{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}}\), which can be verified by checking the dot products are zero.
