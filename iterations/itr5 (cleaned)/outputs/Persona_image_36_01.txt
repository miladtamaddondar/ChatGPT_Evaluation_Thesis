1. The matrix \( A \) has 4 rows and 6 columns, so it is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix.  
2. The number of pivot columns (nonzero rows in row echelon form) is 3, so the rank of \( A \) is 3.  
3. The dimension of Col \( A \) is the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col } A) = 3\).  
4. The dimension of Nul \( A \) is the number of columns minus the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Nul } A) = 6 - 3 = 3\).  
5. Final answer: \(\dim(\text{Col } A) = 3\), \(\dim(\text{Nul } A) = 3\).
