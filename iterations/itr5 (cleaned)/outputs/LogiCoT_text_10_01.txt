1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( U = \begin{bmatrix}1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct since the echelon form has zeros below each leading entry and each leading entry is to the right of the one above.
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4 (since those columns contain the leading entries in each nonzero row); this is correct by the definition of pivot columns.
3. The basis for \( \text{Col } A \) consists of the corresponding columns of the original matrix \( A \): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7\end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct because the pivot columns of \( A \) form a basis for its column space.
4. To find a basis for \( \text{Nul } A \), write the system \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \) using the echelon form: let \( x_2 = t \) (free variable), and solve for \( x_1, x_3, x_4 \); this is correct since the number of free variables equals the number of non-pivot columns.
5. From the third row: \( 5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0 \); this is correct since the only nonzero entry in the third row is in the fourth column.
6. From the second row: \( 5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies 5x_3 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0 \); this is correct since \( x_4 = 0 \).
7. From the first row: \( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 - 3x_2 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2 \); this is correct since \( x_3 = x_4 = 0 \).
8. Therefore, the general solution is \( \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3t \\ t \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} = t\begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \); this is correct since all variables are expressed in terms of the free variable \( t \).
9. Thus, a basis for \( \text{Nul } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct since the null space is spanned by this vector.
10. The dimension of \( \text{Col } A \) is 3 (number of pivot columns), and the dimension of \( \text{Nul } A \) is 1 (number of free variables); this is correct by the rank-nullity theorem.
11. Final answer: Basis for \( \text{Col } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7\end{bmatrix} \right\} \), basis for \( \text{Nul } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\} \), dimensions are 3 and 1, respectively.
