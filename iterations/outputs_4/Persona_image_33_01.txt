1. To solve part (a), recall that the null space of \(A\), denoted \(\text{Nul }A\), consists of all vectors \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(Ax = 0\), where \(n\) is the number of columns of \(A\); here, \(A\) is a \(4 \times 2\) matrix, so \(n = 2\), thus \(\text{Nul }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\), so \(k = 2\).  
2. To solve part (b), recall that the column space of \(A\), denoted \(\text{Col }A\), consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \(A\), which are vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^4\), so \(\text{Col }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\), so \(k = 4\).  
3. Final answers: (a) \(k = 2\) for \(\text{Nul }A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2\); (b) \(k = 4\) for \(\text{Col }A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^4\).
