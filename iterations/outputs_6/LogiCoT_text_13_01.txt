1. To find the basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\), solve \((A - 4I)\vec{x} = 0\), where \(I\) is the \(4 \times 4\) identity matrix.  
2. Compute \(A - 4I = \begin{bmatrix}3-4 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3-4 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1-4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4-4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\).  
3. Let \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix}\), then the system \((A-4I)\vec{x} = 0\) becomes: \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = 0\), \(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 0\), \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\), \(0 = 0\).  
4. From the third equation, \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0 \implies x_2 = 3x_3\); this is correct by substitution.  
5. Substitute \(x_2 = 3x_3\) into the second equation: \(x_1 - (3x_3) + x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 - 2x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 = 2x_3\); this is consistent with the first equation.  
6. The first equation \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = 0\) also gives \(x_1 = 2x_3\), confirming the previous result.  
7. The fourth variable \(x_4\) does not appear in any equation, so it is free; this is valid since the last row is all zeros.  
8. Let \(x_3 = t\) and \(x_4 = s\), where \(t, s \in \mathbb{R}\), then \(x_1 = 2t\), \(x_2 = 3t\), \(x_3 = t\), \(x_4 = s\).  
9. The general solution is \(\vec{x} = t\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} + s\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\), which is a linear combination of two linearly independent vectors.  
10. Therefore, a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\) is \(\left\{\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\right\}\).
