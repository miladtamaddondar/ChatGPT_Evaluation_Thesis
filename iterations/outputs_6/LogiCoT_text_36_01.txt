1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so the number of columns is 6 and the number of rows is 4.
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1's in each row) in the given row-echelon form is 3 (columns 1, 3, and 4), so the rank of \( A \) is 3.
3. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, \(\text{rank}(A) + \dim(\text{Nul }A) = \) number of columns \( = 6\), so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6 - 3 = 3\).
4. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) is the rank of \(A\), which is 3.
5. Final answer: \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\) and \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).
