1. The matrix \( A \) is already in row echelon form: \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & -4 & 2 & -1 & 6 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -3 & 7 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \).  
2. Identify the pivots: columns 1, 3, and 4 contain leading ones, so the rank of \( A \) is 3.  
3. The number of columns in \( A \) is 6, so the dimension of Nul \( A \) is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).  
4. The dimension of Col \( A \) is the rank, which is 3.  
5. Final answer: The dimension of Nul \( A \) is 3 and the dimension of Col \( A \) is 3.
