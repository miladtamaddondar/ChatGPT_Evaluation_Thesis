1. Description: Let \( W \) be the set of all vectors of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix} \), where \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \); we need to determine if \( W \) is a vector space by checking if it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. 2. Description: Take two arbitrary vectors in \( W \), \( \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} 3a_1 + b_1 \\ 4 \\ a_1 - 5b_1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3a_2 + b_2 \\ 4 \\ a_2 - 5b_2 \end{bmatrix} \), and compute their sum: \( \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} (3a_1 + b_1) + (3a_2 + b_2) \\ 4 + 4 \\ (a_1 - 5b_1) + (a_2 - 5b_2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3(a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2) \\ 8 \\ (a_1 + a_2) - 5(b_1 + b_2) \end{bmatrix} \). 3. Description: The second component of the sum is 8, not 4, so \( \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \notin W \) because vectors in \( W \) must have 4 as their second entry. 4. Description: Since \( W \) is not closed under addition, \( W \) is not a vector space. 5. Final answer: \( W \) is not a vector space because it is not closed under vector addition.
