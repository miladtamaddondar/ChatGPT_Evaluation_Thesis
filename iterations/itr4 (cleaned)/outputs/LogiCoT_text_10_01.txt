1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( U = \begin{bmatrix}1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct since echelon form has zeros below leading entries and each leading entry is to the right of the one above.
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4, as these contain the leading (nonzero) entries; this is verified by observing the first nonzero entry in each nonzero row.
3. The basis for \( \text{Col } A \) is formed by the corresponding columns of \( A \): \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7\end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct because the pivot columns of the original matrix form a basis for the column space.
4. To find a basis for \( \text{Nul } A \), set up the equation \( U\mathbf{x} = 0 \) where \( \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} \); this is valid since the null space is the solution set to \( A\mathbf{x} = 0 \), and row operations do not change the solution set.
5. From the bottom row up: the last nonzero row gives \( 5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0 \); this is correct since the only solution is \( x_4 = 0 \).
6. The second nonzero row gives \( 5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0 \) (since \( x_4 = 0 \)); this is correct as substituting \( x_4 = 0 \) yields \( 5x_3 = 0 \).
7. The first row gives \( x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 - 3x_2 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2 \); this is correct as \( x_3 = x_4 = 0 \).
8. Thus, the general solution is \( \mathbf{x} = x_2 \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \), so a basis for \( \text{Nul } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct since the free variable is \( x_2 \).
9. The dimension of \( \text{Col } A \) is 3 (number of pivot columns), and the dimension of \( \text{Nul } A \) is 1 (number of free variables); this matches the rank-nullity theorem for a \( 4 \times 4 \) matrix.
10. Final answer: The basis for \( \text{Col } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7\end{bmatrix} \right\} \), the basis for \( \text{Nul } A \) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\} \), and their dimensions are 3 and 1, respectively.
