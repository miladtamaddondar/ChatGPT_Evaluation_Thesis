1. To find the eigenvalues, set up the characteristic equation by subtracting \(\lambda\) times the identity matrix and taking the determinant: \(\det\left(\begin{bmatrix}0-\lambda & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2-\lambda & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1-\lambda\end{bmatrix}\right) = 0\).
2. Since the matrix is upper triangular, the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries: \((0-\lambda)(2-\lambda)(1-\lambda) = 0\).
3. The eigenvalues are the roots of the equation: \(\lambda_1 = 0\), \(\lambda_2 = 2\), \(\lambda_3 = 1\).
4. Final answer: The eigenvalues of the matrix are \(0\), \(2\), and \(1\).
