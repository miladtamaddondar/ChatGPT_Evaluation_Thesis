1. The matrix \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p]\) consists of the vectors \(Qr_1, Qr_2, \ldots, Qr_p\) as columns, where each \(r_j\) is an \(n \times 1\) vector and \(Q\) is an \(m \times n\) matrix. 
2. We can write the matrix \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p]\) as the product of \(Q\) and the matrix whose columns are \(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_p\), that is, \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\). 
3. Therefore, the answer is: \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q R\), where \(R = [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\) is an \(n \times p\) matrix.
