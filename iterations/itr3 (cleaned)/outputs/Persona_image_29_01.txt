1. Write the transformation equations: \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, 4x_1 + 5x_2) \).  
2. Set the transformation equal to the given vector: \( (x_1 + x_2, 4x_1 + 5x_2) = (3, 8) \).  
3. Equate the components to form a system of equations: \( x_1 + x_2 = 3 \) and \( 4x_1 + 5x_2 = 8 \).  
4. Solve the first equation for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \).  
5. Substitute \( x_1 \) into the second equation: \( 4(3 - x_2) + 5x_2 = 8 \).  
6. Simplify and solve for \( x_2 \): \( 12 - 4x_2 + 5x_2 = 8 \implies 12 + x_2 = 8 \implies x_2 = 8 - 12 = -4 \).  
7. Substitute \( x_2 = -4 \) back into \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \): \( x_1 = 3 - (-4) = 7 \).  
8. Final answer: The vector \( \mathbf{x} \) such that \( T(\mathbf{x}) = (3, 8) \) is \( \boxed{(7, -4)} \).
