1. The set \( W \) consists of all vectors of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix} \) where \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \). 
2. To check if \( W \) is a vector space, test if it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication and contains the zero vector. 
3. The second entry of every vector in \( W \) is always 4, so the zero vector \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) is not in \( W \). 
4. Therefore, \( W \) is not a vector space because it does not contain the zero vector.
