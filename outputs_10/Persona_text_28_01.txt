1. Recognize that $T(\mathbf{x}) = x_1\mathbf{v}_1 + x_2\mathbf{v}_2$ is a linear transformation that can be represented as matrix multiplication $A\mathbf{x}$, where the columns of $A$ are $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$.  
2. Write the matrix $A$ explicitly by placing $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ as its columns: $A = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 7 \\ 5 & -3 \end{bmatrix}$.  
3. Final answer: The matrix $A$ such that $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$ is $A = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 7 \\ 5 & -3 \end{bmatrix}$.
