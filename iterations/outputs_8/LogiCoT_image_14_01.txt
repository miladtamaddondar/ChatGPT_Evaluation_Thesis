1. To find \( h \) such that the eigenspace for \( \lambda = 5 \) is two-dimensional, we first compute \( A - 5I \): \[ A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix} \] (Subtracting 5 from each diagonal entry is correct.)
2. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of \( A - 5I \); by the rank-nullity theorem, we need \(\text{nullity}(A-5I) = 2\), so \(\text{rank}(A-5I) = 2\) for a \(4 \times 4\) matrix. (This follows from \(\text{nullity} = n - \text{rank}\).)
3. Row reduce \( A-5I \): The last two rows are \([0\ 0\ 0\ 4]\) and \([0\ 0\ 0\ -4]\), which are linearly dependent, so one can be eliminated. (Correct, as multiplying the last row by \(-1\) gives the third row.)
4. Replace the fourth row with the sum of the third and fourth rows: \([0\ 0\ 0\ 0]\), so the matrix becomes \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). (This step is valid and simplifies the matrix.)
5. The third row is nonzero, so it is a pivot row; the first two rows are nonzero unless they are linearly dependent. (We need to check when the first two rows are linearly dependent.)
6. The first two rows are \([0, -2, 6, -1]\) and \([0, -2, h, 0]\); subtract the second row from the first: \([0, 0, 6-h, -1]\). (This is correct algebra.)
7. For the first two rows to be linearly dependent, \(6-h = 0\) and \(-1 = 0\), but \(-1 \neq 0\), so they are never linearly dependent for any \(h\). (This shows both are always pivot rows.)
8. Thus, the matrix has three nonzero rows (first, second, and third) unless the third row is zero, i.e., unless \(4 = 0\), which is never true. (So rank is always 3.)
9. However, if \(h = 6\), then the first two rows become \([0, -2, 6, -1]\) and \([0, -2, 6, 0]\); subtracting gives \([0, 0, 0, -1]\), which is nonzero, so still independent. (Verifying with \(h = 6\) does not reduce rank.)
10. The only way to reduce the rank to 2 is if the third row is zero, i.e., \(4 = 0\), which is not possible; thus, there is an error in the previous reasoning. (Let's check the algebraic multiplicity.)
11. The algebraic multiplicity of \(\lambda = 5\) is the multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial; since the lower \(2 \times 2\) block has eigenvalues 5 and 1, and the upper \(2 \times 2\) block is independent, let's compute the characteristic polynomial.
12. The characteristic polynomial is \(\det(A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{bmatrix} 5-\lambda & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & 3-\lambda & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5-\lambda & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1-\lambda \end{bmatrix}\). (This is correct.)
13. Since the matrix is block upper-triangular, the determinant is the product of the determinants of the diagonal blocks: \((5-\lambda)\begin{vmatrix} 3-\lambda & h \\ 0 & 5-\lambda \end{vmatrix}(1-\lambda)\). (This is correct.)
14. The determinant simplifies to \((5-\lambda)^2(3-\lambda)(1-\lambda)\). (Multiplying out the \(2 \times 2\) block: \((3-\lambda)(5-\lambda)\).)
15. Thus, the algebraic multiplicity of \(\lambda = 5\) is 2. (There are two factors of \(5-\lambda\).)
16. For the eigenspace to be two-dimensional, the geometric multiplicity (nullity of \(A-5I\)) must be 2, which happens if \(\text{rank}(A-5I) = 2\). (By rank-nullity theorem.)
17. From earlier, \(A-5I\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix}\). The last two rows are linearly dependent, so one can be eliminated, leaving three rows.
18. For the rank to drop to 2, the first two rows must be linearly dependent: \([0, -2, 6, -1]\) and \([0, -2, h, 0]\).
19. Set \([0, -2, 6, -1] = k[0, -2, h, 0]\) for some scalar \(k\). Comparing components: \(-2 = k(-2)\) gives \(k = 1\); \(6 = h\cdot 1\) gives \(h = 6\); \(-1 = 0\cdot 1 = 0\), which is not possible.
20. Thus, the first two rows cannot be made linearly dependent for any \(h\), so the maximum nullity is 1, and the eigenspace cannot be two-dimensional for any real \(h\).
21. Final answer: There is no value of \(h\) such that the eigenspace for \(\lambda = 5\) is two-dimensional.
