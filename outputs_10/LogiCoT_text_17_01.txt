1. To find the image of \( p(t) = 5 + 3t \) under \( T \), evaluate \( p(-1) \), \( p(0) \), and \( p(1) \): \( p(-1) = 5 + 3(-1) = 2 \), \( p(0) = 5 + 3(0) = 5 \), \( p(1) = 5 + 3(1) = 8 \). 2. Therefore, \( T(p) = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix} \). 3. To find the matrix of \( T \) relative to the basis \( \{1, t, t^2\} \) for \( \mathbb{P}_2 \) and the standard basis for \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), compute \( T(1) \), \( T(t) \), and \( T(t^2) \): \( T(1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), \( T(t) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), \( T(t^2) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). 4. The matrix for \( T \) is formed by placing these as columns: \( [T] = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \). 5. Verify correctness: Each column is \( T \) applied to a basis vector, and the transformation is linear, so the matrix is correct; the rank is 2, since the second and third columns are linearly dependent, which matches the fact that the images of \( 1, t, t^2 \) are not all linearly independent.
