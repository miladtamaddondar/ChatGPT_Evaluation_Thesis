1. The matrix $A$ has 2 columns, so $\text{Nul }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ since the null space consists of all vectors $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.
2. The matrix $A$ has 4 rows, so $\text{Col }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$ since the column space consists of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$, which are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$.
3. Final answer: (a) $k=2$ for $\text{Nul }A$; (b) $k=4$ for $\text{Col }A$.
