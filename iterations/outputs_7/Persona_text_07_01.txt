1. Recognize that the matrix \(\left[ Q r_1 \; Q r_2 \; \dots \; Q r_p \right]\) is formed by multiplying \(Q\) by each \(r_j\) and placing the results as columns.
2. Observe that \(\left[ Q r_1 \; Q r_2 \; \dots \; Q r_p \right] = Q \left[ r_1 \; r_2 \; \dots \; r_p \right]\) because matrix multiplication distributes over columns.
3. Conclude that the desired product is \(\left[ Q r_1 \; Q r_2 \; \dots \; Q r_p \right] = Q R\), where \(R = \left[ r_1 \; r_2 \; \dots \; r_p \right]\).
