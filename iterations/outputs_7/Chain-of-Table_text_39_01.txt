1. Write the matrix equation as an augmented matrix: $\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & -3 & 4 & a \\ 2 & -6 & 8 & b \end{array}\right]$, where $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ 2a & 2b & 2c \end{bmatrix}$.  
2. Set up the system by equating corresponding entries: $a = 1$, $b = -3$, $c = 4$ from the first row, and $2a = 2$, $2b = -6$, $2c = 8$ from the second row.  
3. Observe that both rows are consistent and give the same solution, so the solution is $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$.
