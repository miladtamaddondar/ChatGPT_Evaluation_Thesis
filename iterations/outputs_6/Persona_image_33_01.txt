1. The null space Nul \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \(n\) is the number of columns of \(A\), and \(A\) has 2 columns, so \(k = 2\).
2. The column space Col \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \(m\) is the number of rows of \(A\), and \(A\) has 4 rows, so \(k = 4\).
3. Final answers: (a) \(k = 2\) for Nul \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\); (b) \(k = 4\) for Col \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\).
