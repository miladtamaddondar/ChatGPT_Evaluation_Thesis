1. To determine if $\mathbf{w}$ is in $\text{Nul }A$, we must check if $A\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$ by multiplying $A$ and $\mathbf{w}$: $A\mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -5 & -3 \\ 6 & -2 & 0 \\ -8 & 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}$.
2. Compute the first entry: $3(1) + (-5)(3) + (-3)(-4) = 3 - 15 + 12 = 0$; this checks out since each multiplication and addition follows standard matrix multiplication rules.
3. Compute the second entry: $6(1) + (-2)(3) + 0(-4) = 6 - 6 + 0 = 0$; this is correct by distributing and summing the products.
4. Compute the third entry: $-8(1) + 4(3) + 1(-4) = -8 + 12 - 4 = 0$; again, the calculation is valid by applying the distributive property.
5. The result is $A\mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, so $\mathbf{w}$ is in $\text{Nul }A$ because multiplying $A$ by $\mathbf{w}$ gives the zero vector.
