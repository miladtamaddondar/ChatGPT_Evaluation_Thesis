1. To find the matrix representation of \(T\) relative to \(\mathcal{B} = \{1, t, t^2\}\), compute \(T\) on each basis vector: \(T(1) = 3 \cdot 1 + (5 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 0)t + (4 \cdot 0 + 0)t^2 = 3 + 5t\); since \(T\) is defined by plugging \(a_0 = 1, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 0\), this is correct.

2. Compute \(T(t)\): \(T(t) = 3 \cdot 0 + (5 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 1)t + (4 \cdot 1 + 0)t^2 = -2t + 4t^2\); this uses \(a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0\), which is correct.

3. Compute \(T(t^2)\): \(T(t^2) = 3 \cdot 0 + (5 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 0)t + (4 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1)t^2 = t^2\); this uses \(a_0 = 0, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1\), which is correct.

4. Express each \(T(\text{basis vector})\) as a coordinate vector in \(\mathcal{B}\): \(T(1) = 3 + 5t + 0t^2 \to \begin{bmatrix}3\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}\), \(T(t) = 0 + (-2)t + 4t^2 \to \begin{bmatrix}0\\-2\\4\end{bmatrix}\), \(T(t^2) = 0 + 0t + 1t^2 \to \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct by matching coefficients.

5. The matrix representation of \(T\) relative to \(\mathcal{B}\) is formed by placing these coordinate vectors as columns: \([T]_{\mathcal{B}} = \begin{bmatrix}3 & 0 & 0\\5 & -2 & 0\\0 & 4 & 1\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as per the definition of the matrix of a linear transformation with respect to a basis.

6. Final answer: The matrix representation of \(T\) relative to \(\mathcal{B}\) is \(\boxed{\begin{bmatrix}3 & 0 & 0\\5 & -2 & 0\\0 & 4 & 1\end{bmatrix}}\).
