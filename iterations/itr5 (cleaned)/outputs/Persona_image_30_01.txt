1. Set up the system of equations from \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2x_2, -x_1 + 3x_2, 3x_1 - 2x_2) = (-1, 4, 9) \).
2. Write the first equation: \( x_1 - 2x_2 = -1 \).
3. Write the second equation: \( -x_1 + 3x_2 = 4 \).
4. Write the third equation: \( 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9 \).
5. Solve the first equation for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = -1 + 2x_2 \).
6. Substitute \( x_1 \) into the second equation: \( -(-1 + 2x_2) + 3x_2 = 4 \).
7. Simplify and solve for \( x_2 \): \( 1 - 2x_2 + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 + x_2 = 4 \implies x_2 = 3 \).
8. Substitute \( x_2 = 3 \) into \( x_1 = -1 + 2x_2 \): \( x_1 = -1 + 2 \times 3 = 5 \).
9. Check the solution in the third equation: \( 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 3 \times 5 - 2 \times 3 = 15 - 6 = 9 \), which is correct.
10. The solution is \( x = (5, 3) \).
