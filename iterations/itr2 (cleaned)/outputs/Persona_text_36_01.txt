1. The matrix $A$ is a $4 \times 6$ matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. To find the dimension of $\text{Nul }A$ (the null space), we need to determine the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the rank of $A$.  
3. The rank of $A$ is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in its row echelon form; from the matrix, the leading entries are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so the rank is 3.  
4. The number of free variables is $6$ (number of columns) minus $3$ (rank), which equals $3$, so $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$.  
5. The dimension of $\text{Col }A$ (the column space) is equal to the rank of $A$, which is $3$, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.  
6. Final answer: $\boxed{\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3,\ \dim(\text{Col }A) = 3}$.
