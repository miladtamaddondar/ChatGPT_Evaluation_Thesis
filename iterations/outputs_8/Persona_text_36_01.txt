1. The matrix $A$ has $4$ rows and $6$ columns, so its size is $4 \times 6$.
2. The dimension of $\text{Col }A$ is the number of pivot columns in $A$; from the row-echelon form, there are pivots in columns $1$, $3$, and $4$, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.
3. The dimension of $\text{Nul }A$ is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the number of pivots: $6 - 3 = 3$, so $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$.
4. Final answer: $\boxed{\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3,\ \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3}$.
