1. The matrix \(A\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\); to answer (a), the null space Nul \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) because \(A\) has 2 columns, so \(k=2\).
2. For (b), the column space Col \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\) because \(A\) has 4 rows, so \(k=4\).
3. Final answer: (a) \(k=2\) for Nul \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\); (b) \(k=4\) for Col \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\).
