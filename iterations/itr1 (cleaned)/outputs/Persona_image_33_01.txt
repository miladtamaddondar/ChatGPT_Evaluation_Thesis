1. To determine the value of \( k \) such that \(\text{Nul } A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), recall that the null space of an \( m \times n \) matrix \( A \) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \( n \) is the number of columns of \( A \); since \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix, \( n = 2 \), so \( k = 2 \).  
2. To determine the value of \( k \) such that \(\text{Col } A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), recall that the column space of an \( m \times n \) matrix \( A \) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \( m \) is the number of rows of \( A \); since \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix, \( m = 4 \), so \( k = 4 \).
