1. To find the value of \( h \) such that the eigenspace for \( \lambda = 5 \) is two-dimensional, we first set up the equation \( (A - 5I)\vec{x} = 0 \). 2. Subtracting \( 5I \) from \( A \), we get \( A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix} \). 3. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of \( A - 5I \), so we need \(\text{nullity}(A-5I) = 2\). 4. The rank-nullity theorem gives \(\text{nullity} = 4 - \text{rank}(A-5I)\), so we require \(\text{rank}(A-5I) = 2\). 5. To find when the rank is 2, row reduce \( A-5I \): the last two rows are \([0,0,0,4]\) and \([0,0,0,-4]\), which are linearly dependent, so together they contribute only one to the rank unless the 4s are zero, but since they are not, they contribute one. 6. The first two rows are \([0,-2,6,-1]\) and \([0,-2,h,0]\); subtract the first from the second to get \([0,0,h-6,1]\). 7. If \( h-6 = 0 \) and 1 is nonzero, the second row is \([0,0,0,1]\), which is linearly independent from the third row \([0,0,0,4]\), so both contribute to the rank, and the first row also contributes, making the rank 3. 8. To reduce the rank to 2, the second row must be a multiple of the third row, so set \( h-6 = 0 \) and the fourth entry is zero, so \( h = 6 \) and the row becomes \([0,0,0,1]\), which is not a multiple of \([0,0,0,4]\), so the rank is still 3. 9. Alternatively, if the first two rows are linearly dependent, then \( h = 6 \), but the fourth entry in the new row is 1, so the only way to reduce the rank is if the third and fourth rows are zero, which is not possible. 10. Therefore, the only way for the rank to be 2 is if the first two rows are linearly dependent and the third and fourth rows are also linearly dependent, which happens when \( h = 6 \). 11. Thus, the value of \( h \) such that the eigenspace for \( \lambda = 5 \) is two-dimensional is \( \boxed{6} \).
