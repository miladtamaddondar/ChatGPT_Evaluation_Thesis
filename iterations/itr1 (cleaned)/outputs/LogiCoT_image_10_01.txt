1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its row echelon form is \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this echelon form is verified by checking that each leading entry is to the right of the one above and all zero rows are at the bottom. 
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4, so the basis for \(\text{Col}\,A\) is formed from the corresponding columns of \(A\): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct by the definition of the column space basis. 
3. The dimension of \(\text{Col}\,A\) is 3 because there are 3 pivot columns, which is verified by the rank of the matrix. 
4. To find a basis for \(\text{Nul}\,A\), set up the equation \(A\vec{x} = 0\) and write the system from the echelon form: \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0\), \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0\), \(5x_4 = 0\); this is correct as it comes directly from the echelon form. 
5. From \(5x_4 = 0\), we get \(x_4 = 0\); from \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0\), substituting \(x_4 = 0\) gives \(x_3 = 0\); from \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0\), substituting \(x_3 = 0\) and \(x_4 = 0\) gives \(x_1 - 3x_2 = 0\) so \(x_1 = 3x_2\); this step is correct by back substitution. 
6. The general solution is \(\vec{x} = x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), so the basis for \(\text{Nul}\,A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct by the definition of the null space basis. 
7. The dimension of \(\text{Nul}\,A\) is 1 because there is one free variable, which is verified by the number of non-pivot columns (only column 2 is non-pivot).
