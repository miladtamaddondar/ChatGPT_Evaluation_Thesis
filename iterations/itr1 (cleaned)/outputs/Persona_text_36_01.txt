1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. The dimension of \( \text{Col }A \) (the column space) is equal to the rank of \( A \), which is the number of leading 1's (pivot columns) in its row-reduced form.  
3. Observing \( A \), the leading entries (pivots) are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so the rank of \( A \) is 3.  
4. The dimension of \( \text{Nul }A \) (the null space) is given by the number of columns minus the rank: \( \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6 - 3 = 3 \).  
5. Therefore, the dimensions are: \( \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3 \) and \( \dim(\text{Col }A) = 3 \).
