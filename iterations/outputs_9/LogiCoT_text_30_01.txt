1. Write the equation $T(\mathbf{x}) = (-1, 4, 9)$ as a system: $T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2x_2, -x_1 + 3x_2, 3x_1 - 2x_2) = (-1, 4, 9)$.  
2. Set up the corresponding system of linear equations: $x_1 - 2x_2 = -1$, $-x_1 + 3x_2 = 4$, $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9$.  
3. Verify that the system is consistent by checking if the equations are compatible; for this, use the first two equations to solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$.  
4. Add the first and second equations: $(x_1 - 2x_2) + (-x_1 + 3x_2) = -1 + 4 \implies x_2 = 3$.  
5. Substitute $x_2 = 3$ into the first equation: $x_1 - 2(3) = -1 \implies x_1 - 6 = -1 \implies x_1 = 5$.  
6. Verify $(x_1, x_2) = (5, 3)$ in the third equation: $3(5) - 2(3) = 15 - 6 = 9$, which matches the right-hand side, so the solution is valid.  
7. Final answer: $\mathbf{x} = (5, 3)$.
