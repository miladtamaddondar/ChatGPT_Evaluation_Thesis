1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix because it has 4 rows and 6 columns. 
2. The rank of \( A \) is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in its row echelon form, which are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so \(\text{rank}(A) = 3\). 
3. The dimension of the column space \(\text{Col }A\) is equal to the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\). 
4. The dimension of the null space \(\text{Nul }A\) is given by the number of columns minus the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6 - 3 = 3\). 
5. Final answer: \(\boxed{\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3, \quad \dim(\text{Col }A) = 3}\).
