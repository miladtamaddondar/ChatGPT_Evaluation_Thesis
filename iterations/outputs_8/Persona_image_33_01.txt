1. The matrix \( A \) has 2 columns and 4 rows, so it is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix.  
2. The null space of \( A \), \(\text{Nul }A\), consists of all vectors \( \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \), so \( k = 2 \) for part (a).  
3. The column space of \( A \), \(\text{Col }A\), consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so \( k = 4 \) for part (b).  
4. Final answers: (a) \( k = 2 \), (b) \( k = 4 \).
