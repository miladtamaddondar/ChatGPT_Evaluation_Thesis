1. The set $W$ consists of all vectors of the form $\begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix}$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$; to determine if $W$ is a vector space, check if it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication and contains the zero vector. 
2. The zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$; set $3a + b = 0$, $4 = 0$, and $a - 5b = 0$; the equation $4 = 0$ has no solution, so the zero vector is not in $W$. 
3. Since $W$ does not contain the zero vector, $W$ is not a vector space; thus, there is no spanning set $S$ for $W$.
