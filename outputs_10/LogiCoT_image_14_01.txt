1. Substitute \(\lambda = 5\) into \(A - \lambda I\) to get the matrix whose null space is the eigenspace: \(A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix}\). 2. Verify correctness: Subtracting 5 from each diagonal entry is correct. 3. The eigenspace for \(\lambda = 5\) is the null space of this matrix, and we want its dimension to be 2, so the rank must be \(4 - 2 = 2\). 4. Row reduce: The last two rows are multiples, so row 4 can be replaced with row 3 divided by 4, giving \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). 5. Verify correctness: The last row is now all zeros, so the rank is at most 3; to get rank 2, one more row must be a linear combination of the others. 6. Focus on the first two rows: Subtract row 1 from row 2 (since their first entries are zero), giving row 2 as \([0, 0, h-6, 1]\). 7. For the rank to be 2, row 2 must be a multiple of row 1, so set \(h-6 = 0\) and \(1 = 0\), but \(1 = 0\) is impossible, so instead, the only way for rank to drop is for both row 1 and row 2 to be multiples, i.e., \(h = 6\) and the second entry of row 2 is zero. 8. Substitute \(h = 6\) into row 2: \([0, -2, 6, 0]\), which is a multiple of row 1 \([0, -2, 6, -1]\) only if the last entry is also zero, so set \(-1 = 0\), which is not possible, so check the original matrix for possible errors. 9. Instead, since the last two rows are already dependent, for rank 2, the first two rows must be dependent, so set \(h\) so that row 2 is a multiple of row 1: \(\frac{h}{6} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1\), so \(h = 6\). 10. Verify: With \(h = 6\), row 2 is \([0, -2, 6, 0]\), which is a multiple of row 1 except for the last entry, so the only way rank is 2 is if the last entry in row 1 is zero, which is not the case, so check for another dependency. 11. Since the third and fourth rows are already dependent, and the first entry in both row 1 and row 2 is zero, the only way for rank to be 2 is if the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix \(\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 6 \\ -2 & h \end{bmatrix}\) is singular, i.e., determinant zero: \((-2)h - (-2)6 = 0 \implies -2h + 12 = 0 \implies h = 6\). 12. Therefore, the value of \(h\) that makes the eigenspace for \(\lambda = 5\) two-dimensional is \(\boxed{h = 6}\).
