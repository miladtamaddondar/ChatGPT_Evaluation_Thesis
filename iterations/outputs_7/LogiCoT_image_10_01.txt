1. The matrix \( A \) and its echelon form are given as \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \text{Echelon form of } A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct as the echelon form has leading ones and zeros below each leading entry.  
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4, since these contain the leading entries in each nonzero row; this is correct by the definition of pivot columns.  
3. A basis for \(\text{Col } A\) is formed by the corresponding columns of the original matrix \(A\): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct by the basis theorem for the column space.  
4. The dimension of \(\text{Col } A\) is 3, since there are 3 pivot columns; this is correct by the rank theorem.  
5. To find a basis for \(\text{Nul } A\), solve \(A\vec{x} = 0\) using the echelon form: let \(x_2 = s\) (free variable), then back-substitute from the bottom up; this is correct because the number of free variables equals the number of non-pivot columns.  
6. From the third row: \(5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0\); this is correct since the only solution is \(x_4 = 0\).  
7. From the second row: \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies 5x_3 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0\); this is correct since \(x_4 = 0\).  
8. From the first row: \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 - 3x_2 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2\); this is correct since \(x_3 = x_4 = 0\).  
9. The general solution is \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3x_2 \\ x_2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as it expresses the solution in terms of the free variable.  
10. A basis for \(\text{Nul } A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct since it spans the null space and is linearly independent.  
11. The dimension of \(\text{Nul } A\) is 1, since there is one free variable; this is correct by the rank-nullity theorem.
