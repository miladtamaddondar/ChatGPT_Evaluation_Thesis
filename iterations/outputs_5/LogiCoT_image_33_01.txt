1. The matrix \( A \) is given as \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \), which is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix, meaning it has 4 rows and 2 columns.  
2. The null space of \( A \), denoted \( \text{Nul }A \), consists of all vectors \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), so \( \text{Nul }A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), thus \( k = 2 \).  
3. The column space of \( A \), denoted \( \text{Col }A \), is the span of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so \( \text{Col }A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), thus \( k = 4 \).  
4. Final answers: (a) \( k = 2 \) for \( \text{Nul }A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k \); (b) \( k = 4 \) for \( \text{Col }A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k \).
