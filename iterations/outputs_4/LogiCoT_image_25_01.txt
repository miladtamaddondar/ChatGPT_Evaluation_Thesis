1. Let the unknown matrix be \( A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix} \), so \( A \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3x_1 - 2x_3 \\ 4x_1 \\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct because matrix multiplication gives a linear combination of the variables.
2. Write out the first row: \( a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 3x_1 - 2x_3 \); this matches the first entry on the right.
3. Equate coefficients for the first row: \( a_{11} = 3, a_{12} = 0, a_{13} = -2 \); this is correct because the coefficients must match for all \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \).
4. Write out the second row: \( a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 4x_1 \); this matches the second entry on the right.
5. Equate coefficients for the second row: \( a_{21} = 4, a_{22} = 0, a_{23} = 0 \); this is correct because only \( x_1 \) appears.
6. Write out the third row: \( a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \); this matches the third entry on the right.
7. Equate coefficients for the third row: \( a_{31} = 1, a_{32} = -1, a_{33} = 1 \); this is correct because the coefficients must match.
8. The completed matrix is \( \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & -2 \\ 4 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \); this is verified by multiplying it by \( \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} \) and checking that the result matches the right side for all values of the variables.
