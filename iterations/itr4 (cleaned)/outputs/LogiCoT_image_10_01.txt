1. The matrix \( A \) is given as \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct because each leading entry is to the right of the one above it and all zero rows are at the bottom.
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4; this is correct because these columns contain the leading entries (pivots) in each nonzero row.
3. The basis for \(\text{Col }A\) is formed by the corresponding columns of \(A\): \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct by the definition of the column space basis using pivot columns.
4. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) is 3, since there are 3 pivot columns; this is correct because the number of pivots equals the rank of \(A\).
5. To find a basis for \(\text{Nul }A\), set up the equation \(A\vec{x} = 0\) and write the variables corresponding to non-pivot columns as free variables; here, \(x_2\) is free.
6. Express the leading variables in terms of the free variable \(x_2\) using the row-reduced equations: from the third row, \(5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0\); from the second row, \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0\); from the first row, \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2\).
7. The general solution to \(A\vec{x} = 0\) is \( \vec{x} = x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct because all other variables are zero except for the free variable \(x_2\).
8. The basis for \(\text{Nul }A\) is \( \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\} \); this is correct because it spans the null space and is linearly independent.
9. The dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) is 1, since there is 1 free variable; this is correct by the rank-nullity theorem, as \(4 - 3 = 1\).
