1. The matrix $A$ is $4 \times 6$, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1s in each row) in $A$ is 3 (columns 1, 3, and 4).
3. The dimension of $\text{Col }A$ is the number of pivot columns, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.
4. The dimension of $\text{Nul }A$ is the number of free variables, which is total columns minus pivot columns: $6 - 3 = 3$.
5. Final answer: $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$ and $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$.
