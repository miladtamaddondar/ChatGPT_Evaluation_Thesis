1. The matrix \( A \) has 4 rows and 2 columns, so \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix.
2. The null space \( \text{Nul }A \) consists of all vectors \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), so \( k = 2 \) for part (a).
3. The column space \( \text{Col }A \) consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so \( k = 4 \) for part (b).
4. Final answers: (a) \( k = 2 \), (b) \( k = 4 \).
