1. The matrix $A$ is a $4 \times 6$ matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. To determine $\text{Nul }A$ and $\text{Col }A$, we need the rank of $A$, which is the number of leading 1's in its row-reduced echelon form.  
3. The given matrix $A$ is already in row-echelon form, with leading 1's in columns 1, 3, and 4, so the rank of $A$ is 3.  
4. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, $\text{rank}(A) + \dim(\text{Nul }A) = n$, where $n$ is the number of columns, so $3 + \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6$.  
5. Solving for $\dim(\text{Nul }A)$ gives $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6 - 3 = 3$.  
6. The dimension of the column space $\text{Col }A$ is equal to the rank of $A$, so $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.  
7. Final answer: $\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3$ and $\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3$.
