1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns. 
2. The dimension of Col \( A \) (the column space) is the rank of \( A \), which is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in its row echelon form; here, there are 3 pivots (in columns 1, 4, and 5). 
3. Therefore, \(\text{dim}(\text{Col } A) = 3\). 
4. The dimension of Nul \( A \) (the null space) is the number of free variables, which is the total number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\). 
5. Therefore, \(\text{dim}(\text{Nul } A) = 3\).
