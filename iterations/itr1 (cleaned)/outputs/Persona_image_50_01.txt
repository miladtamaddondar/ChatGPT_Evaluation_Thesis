1. The inner product on \(\mathbb{P}_3\) is defined as \(\langle f, g \rangle = f(-3)g(-3) + f(-1)g(-1) + f(1)g(1) + f(3)g(3)\).
2. The polynomials are \(p_0(t) = 1\), \(p_1(t) = t\), and \(p_2(t) = t^2\).
3. To project \(p_2\) onto \(\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}\), we seek \(a, b\) such that the projection is \(a p_0 + b p_1\).
4. The orthogonal projection formula is \(\text{proj}_W(v) = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{\langle v, w_i \rangle}{\langle w_i, w_i \rangle} w_i\), where \(\{w_i\}\) is an orthogonal basis for \(W\); here, \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) are already linearly independent but not orthogonal, so we use the general formula for projection onto a subspace spanned by non-orthogonal vectors.
5. Compute the Gram matrix \(G\) with entries \(G_{ij} = \langle p_i, p_j \rangle\) for \(i,j = 0,1\): \(\langle p_0, p_0 \rangle = 4\), \(\langle p_0, p_1 \rangle = (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 3 = 0\), \(\langle p_1, p_1 \rangle = (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 = 20\).
6. Compute \(\langle p_2, p_0 \rangle = (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 = 20\), \(\langle p_2, p_1 \rangle = (-3)^2(-3) + (-1)^2(-1) + 1^2(1) + 3^2(3) = -27 - 1 + 1 + 27 = 0\).
7. Since the Gram matrix is diagonal, the projection is \(\frac{\langle p_2, p_0 \rangle}{\langle p_0, p_0 \rangle} p_0 + \frac{\langle p_2, p_1 \rangle}{\langle p_1, p_1 \rangle} p_1 = \frac{20}{4}p_0 + \frac{0}{20}p_1 = 5p_0\).
8. The orthogonal projection of \(p_2\) onto \(\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}\) is \(5\).
9. To find \(q\) orthogonal to \(p_0\) and \(p_1\), let \(q(t) = p_2(t) - \text{proj}_{\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}} p_2 = t^2 - 5\).
10. Check orthogonality: \(\langle q, p_0 \rangle = \langle t^2 - 5, 1 \rangle = \langle t^2, 1 \rangle - 5\langle 1, 1 \rangle = 20 - 20 = 0\), \(\langle q, p_1 \rangle = \langle t^2, t \rangle - 5\langle 1, t \rangle = 0 - 0 = 0\).
11. The polynomial \(q(t) = t^2 - 5\) is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\).
12. Evaluate \(q\) at \(-3, -1, 1, 3\): \(q(-3) = 9 - 5 = 4\), \(q(-1) = 1 - 5 = -4\), \(q(1) = 1 - 5 = -4\), \(q(3) = 9 - 5 = 4\).
13. To scale \(q\) so its values at \((-3, -1, 1, 3)\) are \((1, -1, -1, 1)\), set \(kq(t)\) and solve \(k \cdot 4 = 1\) so \(k = \frac{1}{4}\).
14. The desired polynomial is \(q(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t^2 - 5)\).
15. Final answer: (a) The orthogonal projection of \(p_2\) onto the subspace spanned by \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) is \(5\); (b) The polynomial \(q(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t^2 - 5)\) is orthogonal to \(p_0\) and \(p_1\), and its values at \((-3, -1, 1, 3)\) are \((1, -1, -1, 1)\).
