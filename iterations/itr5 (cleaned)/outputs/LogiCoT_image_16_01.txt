1. To find the matrix representation of \( T \) relative to the basis \( \mathcal{B} = \{1, t, t^2\} \), we first compute \( T \) applied to each basis vector: \( T(1) \), \( T(t) \), and \( T(t^2) \).  
2. Compute \( T(1) \): Set \( a_0 = 1, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 0 \) so \( T(1) = 3(1) + (5 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 0)t + (4 \cdot 0 + 0)t^2 = 3 + 5t \); this is correct since we substituted the basis vector into the formula.  
3. Compute \( T(t) \): Set \( a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0 \) so \( T(t) = 3(0) + (5 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 1)t + (4 \cdot 1 + 0)t^2 = -2t + 4t^2 \); this is correct by substitution.  
4. Compute \( T(t^2) \): Set \( a_0 = 0, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1 \) so \( T(t^2) = 3(0) + (5 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 0)t + (4 \cdot 0 + 1)t^2 = t^2 \); this is correct by substitution.  
5. Express each result as a coordinate vector relative to \( \mathcal{B} \): \( T(1) = 3 + 5t + 0t^2 \to \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( T(t) = 0 + (-2)t + 4t^2 \to \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} \), \( T(t^2) = 0 + 0t + 1t^2 \to \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct since each polynomial is written in the basis order.  
6. Form the matrix by placing these coordinate vectors as columns: \[ [T]_{\mathcal{B}} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 5 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]; this is correct since the columns correspond to the images of the basis vectors.  
7. The matrix representation of \( T \) relative to \( \mathcal{B} \) is \(\boxed{\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 5 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}}\).
