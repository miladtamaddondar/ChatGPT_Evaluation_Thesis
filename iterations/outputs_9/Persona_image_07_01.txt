1. Notice that multiplying Q by each vector \( r_i \) is the same as multiplying Q by the matrix whose columns are \( r_1, \ldots, r_p \): \([Qr_1\ Qr_2\ \ldots\ Qr_p] = Q [r_1\ r_2\ \ldots\ r_p]\).
2. Therefore, the matrix \([Qr_1\ Qr_2\ \ldots\ Qr_p]\) can be written as the product \(Q [r_1\ r_2\ \ldots\ r_p]\).
