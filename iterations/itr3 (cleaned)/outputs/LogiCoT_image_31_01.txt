1. Identify the set \( W \) as all vectors of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix} \) where \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \). 
2. Test if \( W \) is closed under vector addition by adding two arbitrary elements: \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a_1 + b_1 \\ 4 \\ a_1 - 5b_1 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 3a_2 + b_2 \\ 4 \\ a_2 - 5b_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3(a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2) \\ 8 \\ (a_1 + a_2) - 5(b_1 + b_2) \end{bmatrix} \). 
3. Notice that the second component is \( 8 \), not \( 4 \), so the sum is not in \( W \) since the second component must always be \( 4 \) for all elements of \( W \). 
4. Conclude that \( W \) is not closed under addition and therefore is not a vector space. 
5. Final answer: \( W \) is not a vector space because it is not closed under vector addition.
