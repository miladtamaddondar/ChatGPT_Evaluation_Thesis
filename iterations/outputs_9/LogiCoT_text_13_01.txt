1. To find a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\), we solve \((A - 4I)\vec{x} = 0\); first, compute \(A - 4I\): \[A - 4I = \begin{bmatrix}3-4 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3-4 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1-4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4-4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]; this is correct since we subtracted 4 from each diagonal entry.
2. Set up the homogeneous system \((A - 4I)\vec{x} = 0\) with \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix}\), yielding the equations: \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = 0\), \(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 0\), \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\), and \(0 = 0\); this is correct by matrix multiplication.
3. From the third equation, \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\) so \(x_2 = 3x_3\); this is valid by isolating \(x_2\).
4. Substitute \(x_2 = 3x_3\) into the second equation: \(x_1 - (3x_3) + x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 - 2x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 = 2x_3\); this is correct by algebraic manipulation.
5. Substitute \(x_1 = 2x_3\) into the first equation: \(-2x_3 + 2x_3 = 0\), which is always satisfied; this confirms consistency.
6. The variable \(x_4\) is free since it does not appear in any equation; thus, the general solution is \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}2x_3 \\ 3x_3 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = x_3\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} + x_4\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as both \(x_3\) and \(x_4\) are free variables.
7. Therefore, a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\) is \(\left\{\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\right\}\); this is correct since these vectors are linearly independent and span the solution set.
