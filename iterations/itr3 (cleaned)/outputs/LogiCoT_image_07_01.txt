1. The matrix \([Qr_1\ Qr_2\ \ldots\ Qr_p]\) can be interpreted as applying the matrix \(Q\) to each vector \(r_i\) and concatenating the results into a single matrix. 
2. Let \(R = [r_1\ r_2\ \ldots\ r_p]\) be the \(n \times p\) matrix whose columns are the vectors \(r_1, \ldots, r_p\), so the matrix can be written as \(Q R\). 
3. Therefore, \([Qr_1\ Qr_2\ \ldots\ Qr_p] = Q [r_1\ r_2\ \ldots\ r_p] = Q R\), which is the product of the \(m \times n\) matrix \(Q\) and the \(n \times p\) matrix \(R\), neither of which is an identity matrix. 
4. Verification: By the definition of matrix multiplication, the \(i\)-th column of \(Q R\) is \(Q r_i\), so the product \(Q R\) indeed gives \([Qr_1\ Qr_2\ \ldots\ Qr_p]\).
