1. The matrix \( A \) has 4 rows and 6 columns, so it is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix.  
2. The dimension of Col \( A \) is the rank of \( A \), which is the number of leading 1's (pivot columns) in its row echelon form; here, there are 3 nonzero rows, so \(\text{rank}(A) = 3\).  
3. The dimension of Nul \( A \) is the number of free variables, calculated as the number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\).  
4. Therefore, the dimension of Col \( A \) is 3 and the dimension of Nul \( A \) is 3.
