1. To find $h$ such that the eigenspace for $\lambda=5$ is two-dimensional, we first compute $A - 5I$:\[A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix}\].
2. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of $A-5I$; by the rank-nullity theorem, $\text{nullity}(A-5I) = 4 - \text{rank}(A-5I)$.
3. For the eigenspace to be two-dimensional, $\text{nullity}(A-5I) = 2$, so $\text{rank}(A-5I) = 2$.
4. We row-reduce $A-5I$ to find $h$ such that its rank is $2$; the last two rows are $[0,0,0,4]$ and $[0,0,0,-4]$, which are linearly dependent, so only one contributes to the rank.
5. The first two rows are $[0, -2, 6, -1]$ and $[0, -2, h, 0]$; subtracting the second row from the first gives $[0, 0, 6-h, -1]$.
6. For these two rows to be linearly dependent (so that the rank is not $3$), the second row must be a scalar multiple of the first: $[0, -2, h, 0] = k[0, -2, 6, -1]$ for some $k$.
7. Comparing components: $-2 = k(-2)$ gives $k=1$; $h = k \cdot 6 = 6$; $0 = k \cdot (-1) = -1$, which is only true if $k=0$, but $k=1$ from the previous step, so the only way for the two rows to be linearly dependent is if $h=6$ and the $-1$ in the first row's last entry is $0$.
8. Since the $-1$ in the first row's last entry is not $0$, the first two rows are linearly independent unless $6-h=0$ and $-1=0$, which is impossible, so the only way to reduce the rank is if the first two rows become linearly dependent by $h=6$ and the $-1$ is ignored due to the structure of the matrix.
9. Alternatively, set $h=6$ and check the rank: with $h=6$, the first two rows are $[0, -2, 6, -1]$ and $[0, -2, 6, 0]$; subtracting the first from the second gives $[0, 0, 0, 1]$, so the rows are still linearly independent, so the rank is $3$.
10. To reduce the rank to $2$, the first two rows must be linearly dependent; this occurs if $h$ is such that the third entry of the second row is a linear combination of the other entries, i.e., $[0, -2, h, 0] = a[0, -2, 6, -1] + b[0, 0, 0, 4]$.
11. Since the third and fourth rows are linearly dependent, only one counts toward the rank, so for the rank to be $2$, the first two rows must also be linearly dependent, which occurs only if $h=6$ and $-1=0$, which is not possible.
12. Re-examining, the only way for the rank to be $2$ is if the first two rows are multiples of each other and the third and fourth rows are multiples, which is only possible if $h=6$ and $-1=0$, but $-1\neq 0$.
13. Therefore, there is no real value of $h$ that makes the first two rows linearly dependent, so the only way for the rank to be $2$ is if the third and fourth rows are both zero, which is not possible.
14. However, if $h=-2$, then the second row becomes $[0, -2, -2, 0]$, and the first row is $[0, -2, 6, -1]$; subtracting $3$ times the second row from the first gives $[0, 0, 12, -1]$, so still linearly independent.
15. Therefore, the only way for the rank to be $2$ is if $h=6$ and the $-1$ in the first row is $0$, which is not possible; thus, the question may have a misstatement, or the only possible value is $h=6$.
16. Final answer: $h=6$ is the value such that the eigenspace for $\lambda=5$ is two-dimensional.
