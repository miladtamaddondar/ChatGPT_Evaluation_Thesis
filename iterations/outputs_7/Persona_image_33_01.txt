1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix, so it has 2 columns and 4 rows.
2. The null space of \( A \) (Nul \( A \)) consists of all vectors \( x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( Ax = 0 \), so Nul \( A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), thus \( k = 2 \) for part (a).
3. The column space of \( A \) (Col \( A \)) consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so Col \( A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), thus \( k = 4 \) for part (b).
4. Final answers: (a) \( k = 2 \), (b) \( k = 4 \).
