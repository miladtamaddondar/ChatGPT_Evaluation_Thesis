1. Write the system of equations given by \( T(x_1, x_2) = (-1, 4, 9) \): \( x_1 - 2x_2 = -1 \), \( -x_1 + 3x_2 = 4 \), \( 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9 \).  
2. Verify that this is a system of three equations in two unknowns, which may be overdetermined, so check for consistency.  
3. Solve the first equation for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = -1 + 2x_2 \).  
4. Substitute \( x_1 \) into the second equation: \( -(-1 + 2x_2) + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 - 2x_2 + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 + x_2 = 4 \).  
5. Solve for \( x_2 \): \( x_2 = 3 \).  
6. Substitute \( x_2 = 3 \) into the expression for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = -1 + 2 \times 3 = -1 + 6 = 5 \).  
7. Verify the solution in the third equation: \( 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 3 \times 5 - 2 \times 3 = 15 - 6 = 9 \), which matches the given value.  
8. Conclude that the solution is \( \boxed{(x_1, x_2) = (5, 3)} \).
