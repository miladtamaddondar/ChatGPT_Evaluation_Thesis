1. The matrix \( A \) is given as \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \), which is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix.  
2. The null space of \( A \), denoted as \( \text{Nul}~A \), consists of all vectors \( \vec{x} \) such that \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), where \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \).  
3. Therefore, \( \text{Nul}~A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), so for part (a), \( k = 2 \).  
4. The column space of \( A \), denoted as \( \text{Col}~A \), consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).  
5. Therefore, \( \text{Col}~A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so for part (b), \( k = 4 \).  
6. Final answers: (a) \( k = 2 \), (b) \( k = 4 \).
