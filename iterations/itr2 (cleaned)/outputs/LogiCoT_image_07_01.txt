1. Recognize that \( Qr_1, Qr_2, \ldots, Qr_p \) are the results of multiplying the matrix \( Q \) (of size \( m \times n \)) by each vector \( r_i \) (of size \( n \times 1 \)), so the matrix \( [Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] \) is of size \( m \times p \). 
2. Observe that the matrix \( [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] \) is an \( n \times p \) matrix whose columns are the vectors \( r_1, \ldots, r_p \). 
3. Note that multiplying \( Q \) (size \( m \times n \)) by \( [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] \) (size \( n \times p \)) yields an \( m \times p \) matrix whose \( i \)-th column is \( Qr_i \), so \( Q[r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] = [Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] \). 
4. Therefore, the matrix \( [Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] \) can be written as the product of two matrices: \( Q \) and \( [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] \), i.e., \( [Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q[r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] \). 5. Verification: By the definition of matrix multiplication, the \( j \)-th column of \( Q[r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] \) is \( Qr_j \), matching the construction of the original matrix, so the factorization is correct.
