1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its row echelon form is \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this echelon form is verified by checking that each leading entry is to the right of the one above and all entries below a leading entry are zero. 
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4, so the basis for \(\operatorname{Col} A\) is given by the corresponding columns of \(A\): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct by the definition of a column space basis using pivot columns. 
3. The dimension of \(\operatorname{Col} A\) is 3, since there are 3 pivot columns; this is verified by the rank of the matrix, which is the number of pivots. 
4. To find a basis for \(\operatorname{Nul} A\), set up the homogeneous system \(A\vec{x} = \vec{0}\) and write the general solution using the echelon form; let \(x_2 = t\) (free variable), then back-substitute: from row 3, \(5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0\); from row 2, \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0\); from row 1, \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2\); so the general solution is \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 3t \\ t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), thus a basis for \(\operatorname{Nul} A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is verified by substituting into \(A\vec{x} = \vec{0}\) and confirming the result is the zero vector. 
5. The dimension of \(\operatorname{Nul} A\) is 1, since there is 1 free variable; this is verified by the rank-nullity theorem: \(4 = \operatorname{rank}(A) + \operatorname{nullity}(A) = 3 + 1\).
