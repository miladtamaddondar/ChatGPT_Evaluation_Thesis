1. Write the vectors as columns of a matrix \(A = [\mathbf{v}_1 \ \mathbf{v}_2 \ \mathbf{v}_3 \ \mathbf{v}_4]\): \[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \] This step is correct because the span of the vectors is the column space of this matrix.
2. Row reduce \(A\) to row echelon form to find the linearly independent columns: Start with the first column as the pivot and use row operations to eliminate below. This is correct because the number of pivots equals the dimension of the span.
3. Subtract \(-3\) times row 1 from row 2: Row 2 becomes \((-3) - (-3 \times 1) = 0\), \(9 - (-3 \times -3) = 0\), \((-1) - (-3 \times 2) = 5\), \(5 - (-3 \times -4) = -7\). So, row 2 is now \([0 \ 0 \ 5 \ -7]\). This is correct by linear algebraic row operations.
4. Subtract \(2\) times row 1 from row 3: Row 3 becomes \(2 - 2 \times 1 = 0\), \(-6 - 2 \times -3 = 0\), \(4 - 2 \times 2 = 0\), \(-3 - 2 \times -4 = 5\). So, row 3 is now \([0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 5]\). This is correct.
5. Subtract \(-4\) times row 1 from row 4: Row 4 becomes \(-4 - (-4 \times 1) = 0\), \(12 - (-4 \times -3) = 0\), \(2 - (-4 \times 2) = 10\), \(7 - (-4 \times -4) = -9\). So, row 4 is now \([0 \ 0 \ 10 \ -9]\). This is correct.
6. The matrix is now: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 10 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \] Now, subtract 2 times row 2 from row 4: \(10 - 2 \times 5 = 0\), \(-9 - 2 \times -7 = 5\). So, row 4 is now \([0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 5]\). This is correct.
7. Now, row 3 and row 4 are both \([0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 5]\), so subtract row 3 from row 4 to get row 4 as all zeros. This is correct.
8. The row echelon form is now: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \] There are 3 nonzero rows, so the rank is 3 and the dimension of the subspace is 3. This is correct.
9. The pivot columns are columns 1, 3, and 4, so the basis is \(\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4\}\). This is correct because pivot columns in the original matrix form a basis for the column space.
10. Final answer: A basis for the subspace is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\) and the dimension of the subspace is 3.
