1. The matrix \(A\) is given as \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\), which has 4 rows and 2 columns. 
2. For part (a), the null space \(\text{Nul }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \(n\) is the number of columns, so \(k=2\). 
3. For part (b), the column space \(\text{Col }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \(m\) is the number of rows, so \(k=4\). 
4. Final answers: (a) \(k=2\) for \(\text{Nul }A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2\), (b) \(k=4\) for \(\text{Col }A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^4\).
