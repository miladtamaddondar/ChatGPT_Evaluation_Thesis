1. The matrix \( A \) is already in row echelon form, so we can directly count the pivots (leading 1s) to find the rank: there are 3 pivots (columns 1, 3, and 4). 2. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) (the column space) is the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\). 3. The dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) (the null space) is the number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\), so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\). 4. Final answer: \(\boxed{\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3, \ \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3}\).
