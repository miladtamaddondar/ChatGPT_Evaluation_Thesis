1. The standard basis for \(\mathbb{P}_2\) is \(\{1, t, t^2\}\), and the given basis is \(\mathcal{B} = \{1 - 3t^2,\, 2 + t - 5t^2,\, 1 + 2t\}\).  
2. To find the change-of-coordinates matrix from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the standard basis, write each vector in \(\mathcal{B}\) as a coordinate vector relative to the standard basis: \(1 - 3t^2 = [1, 0, -3]^T\), \(2 + t - 5t^2 = [2, 1, -5]^T\), \(1 + 2t = [1, 2, 0]^T\).  
3. The change-of-coordinates matrix \(P\) from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the standard basis is formed by placing these coordinate vectors as columns: \(P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).  
4. To write \(t^2\) as a linear combination of the polynomials in \(\mathcal{B}\), solve \(c_1(1 - 3t^2) + c_2(2 + t - 5t^2) + c_3(1 + 2t) = t^2\).  
5. Expanding and collecting like terms gives: \((c_1 + 2c_2 + c_3) + (c_2 + 2c_3)t + (-3c_1 - 5c_2)t^2 = 0 + 0t + 1t^2\).  
6. Equate coefficients: \(c_1 + 2c_2 + c_3 = 0\), \(c_2 + 2c_3 = 0\), \(-3c_1 - 5c_2 = 1\).  
7. From the second equation, \(c_2 = -2c_3\); substitute into the first: \(c_1 + 2(-2c_3) + c_3 = 0 \implies c_1 - 4c_3 + c_3 = 0 \implies c_1 = 3c_3\).  
8. Substitute \(c_1 = 3c_3\) and \(c_2 = -2c_3\) into the third equation: \(-3(3c_3) - 5(-2c_3) = 1 \implies -9c_3 + 10c_3 = 1 \implies c_3 = 1\).  
9. Therefore, \(c_1 = 3\) and \(c_2 = -2\), so \(t^2 = 3(1 - 3t^2) - 2(2 + t - 5t^2) + 1(1 + 2t)\).  
10. Final answers: The change-of-coordinates matrix is \(P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(t^2 = 3(1 - 3t^2) - 2(2 + t - 5t^2) + 1(1 + 2t)\) as a linear combination of the polynomials in \(\mathcal{B}\).
