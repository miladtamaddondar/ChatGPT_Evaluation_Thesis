1. To find the matrix representation of $T$ relative to $\mathcal{B}$, we apply $T$ to each basis vector in $\mathcal{B}$ and express the result as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
2. Compute $T(1)$: $T(1) = 3 \cdot 1 + (5 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 0)t + (4 \cdot 0 + 0)t^2 = 3 + 5t + 0t^2$; thus, the coordinate vector is $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct since $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 0$.
3. Compute $T(t)$: $T(t) = 3 \cdot 0 + (5 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 1)t + (4 \cdot 1 + 0)t^2 = 0 - 2t + 4t^2$; thus, the coordinate vector is $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct since $a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0$.
4. Compute $T(t^2)$: $T(t^2) = 3 \cdot 0 + (5 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 0)t + (4 \cdot 0 + 1)t^2 = 0 + 0t + 1t^2$; thus, the coordinate vector is $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct since $a_0 = 0, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1$.
5. Assemble the coordinate vectors as columns to form the matrix: $[T]_{\mathcal{B}} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 5 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct by the definition of the matrix representation of a linear transformation.
