1. Identify the number of columns in \(A\): \(A\) has 6 columns. 
2. Identify the number of leading 1's (pivots) in the row-reduced form: There are 3 pivots (columns 1, 3, and 4). 
3. The dimension of \(\text{Col}\,A\) (column space) is the number of pivots: \(\dim(\text{Col}\,A) = 3\). 
4. The dimension of \(\text{Nul}\,A\) (null space) is the number of columns minus the number of pivots: \(\dim(\text{Nul}\,A) = 6 - 3 = 3\). 
5. Final answer: \(\boxed{\dim(\text{Col}\,A) = 3,\ \dim(\text{Nul}\,A) = 3}\).
