1. The matrix $A$ has $4$ rows and $2$ columns, so $A$ is a $4 \times 2$ matrix.  
2. The null space $\text{Nul }A$ consists of all vectors $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$, so $\text{Nul }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$; thus, for part (a), $k = 2$.  
3. The column space $\text{Col }A$ is the span of the columns of $A$, which are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$, so $\text{Col }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$; thus, for part (b), $k = 4$.  
4. Final answers: (a) $k = 2$ for $\text{Nul }A$; (b) $k = 4$ for $\text{Col }A$.
