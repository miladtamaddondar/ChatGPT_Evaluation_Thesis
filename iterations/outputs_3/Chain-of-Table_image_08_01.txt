1. To construct a \(4 \times 3\) matrix with rank 1, we need all rows to be scalar multiples of one row, so letâ€™s choose the first row as \((1, 2, 3)\) and multiply it by different scalars for the remaining rows: \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\ -1 & -2 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
