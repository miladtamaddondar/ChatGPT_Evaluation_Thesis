1. We are given the basis \(\mathcal{B} = \{1 + t^2,\, t + t^2,\, 1 + 2t + t^2\}\) for \(\mathbb{P}_2\) and the polynomial \(p(t) = 1 + 4t + 7t^2\), and we are to find the coordinate vector of \(p(t)\) relative to \(\mathcal{B}\).  
2. Write \(p(t)\) as a linear combination of the basis elements: \(p(t) = a(1 + t^2) + b(t + t^2) + c(1 + 2t + t^2)\).  
3. Expand the right side: \(a(1 + t^2) + b(t + t^2) + c(1 + 2t + t^2) = a + at^2 + bt + bt^2 + c + 2ct + ct^2\).  
4. Combine like terms: \((a + c) + (b + 2c)t + (a + b + c)t^2\).  
5. Set this equal to \(p(t)\): \(1 + 4t + 7t^2 = (a + c) + (b + 2c)t + (a + b + c)t^2\).  
6. Equate coefficients: \(a + c = 1\), \(b + 2c = 4\), \(a + b + c = 7\).  
7. Solve the first equation for \(a\): \(a = 1 - c\).  
8. Substitute \(a = 1 - c\) into the third equation: \((1 - c) + b + c = 7 \implies 1 + b = 7 \implies b = 6\).  
9. Substitute \(b = 6\) into the second equation: \(6 + 2c = 4 \implies 2c = -2 \implies c = -1\).  
10. Substitute \(c = -1\) into \(a = 1 - c\): \(a = 1 - (-1) = 2\).  
11. The coordinate vector of \(p(t)\) relative to \(\mathcal{B}\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\).
