1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct because echelon form has zeros below each leading entry.  
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4; this is correct because those columns contain the leading entries in each nonzero row.  
3. The basis for \(\text{Col }A\) is given by the corresponding columns of \(A\): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct because the pivot columns of \(A\) form a basis for the column space.  
4. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) is 3; this is correct because there are 3 pivot columns.  
5. To find a basis for \(\text{Nul }A\), set up the system \(A\vec{x} = 0\) and use the echelon form to write the solution in terms of free variables; this is correct because the null space consists of all solutions to this homogeneous system.  
6. Let \(x_2 = s\) (free variable), and back-substitute from the last nonzero row: from row 3, \(5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0\); from row 2, \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0\); from row 1, \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2\); this is correct because each equation isolates a variable in terms of the free variable.  
7. The general solution is \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 3s \\ s \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = s\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct because it expresses all solutions as scalar multiples of a single vector.  
8. A basis for \(\text{Nul }A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct because the null space is one-dimensional.  
9. The dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) is 1; this is correct because there is one free variable.  
10. Final answers: Basis for \(\text{Col }A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\), dimension is 3; basis for \(\text{Nul }A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\), dimension is 1.
