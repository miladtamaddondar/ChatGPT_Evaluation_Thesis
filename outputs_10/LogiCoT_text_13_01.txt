1. Subtract \(\lambda I\) from \(A\) to get \(A - 4I = \begin{bmatrix}3-4 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3-4 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1-4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4-4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\), which is correct since each diagonal entry is reduced by 4.

2. Set up the equation \((A - 4I)\vec{x} = \vec{0}\), which gives the system: \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = 0\), \(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 0\), \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\), and \(0 = 0\); this is correct as it matches the matrix-vector multiplication.

3. Solve the third equation \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\) to get \(x_2 = 3x_3\), which is correct by direct rearrangement.

4. Substitute \(x_2 = 3x_3\) into the second equation: \(x_1 - (3x_3) + x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 - 2x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 = 2x_3\), which is correct by combining like terms.

5. Substitute \(x_1 = 2x_3\) into the first equation: \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = -2x_3 + 2x_3 = 0\), which is correct and confirms consistency.

6. Let \(x_3 = t\) (free variable) and \(x_4 = s\) (since the fourth column is all zeros), so the general solution is \(\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}2t \\ 3t \\ t \\ s\end{bmatrix} = t\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} + s\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\), which is correct as each variable is expressed in terms of free parameters.

7. Therefore, a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \right\}\), which is correct since these vectors are linearly independent and span the solution set.
