1. Write the transformation in terms of a matrix multiplication: \( T(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (0, x_1 + x_2, x_2 + x_3, x_3 + x_4) \) can be written as \( T(\vec{x}) = A\vec{x} \), where \( \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( A \) is the matrix to be found. 
2. Express each output coordinate as a linear combination of the inputs: The first entry is always 0, so the first row is \( (0, 0, 0, 0) \); the second entry is \( x_1 + x_2 \), so the second row is \( (1, 1, 0, 0) \); the third entry is \( x_2 + x_3 \), so the third row is \( (0, 1, 1, 0) \); the fourth entry is \( x_3 + x_4 \), so the fourth row is \( (0, 0, 1, 1) \). 
3. Write the matrix \( A \) explicitly: \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \). 
4. Final answer: The matrix that implements the mapping is \( \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}} \).
