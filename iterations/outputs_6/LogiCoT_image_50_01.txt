1. The inner product is defined as \(\langle f, g \rangle = f(-3)g(-3) + f(-1)g(-1) + f(1)g(1) + f(3)g(3)\), which is a valid inner product on \(\mathbb{P}_3\) because it is linear, symmetric, and positive definite.  
2. To find the orthogonal projection of \(p_2\) onto \(\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}\), we write \(\text{proj}_{V}(p_2) = a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1\), where \(a_0, a_1\) are chosen so that \(p_2 - (a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1)\) is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\).  
3. We compute the inner products: \(\langle p_0, p_0 \rangle = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4\), \(\langle p_0, p_1 \rangle = 1 \cdot (-3) + 1 \cdot (-1) + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 3 = 0\), \(\langle p_0, p_2 \rangle = 1 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 9 = 20\), \(\langle p_1, p_1 \rangle = (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 = 20\), \(\langle p_1, p_2 \rangle = (-3) \cdot 9 + (-1) \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 9 = 0\).  
4. The coefficients are \(a_0 = \frac{\langle p_2, p_0 \rangle}{\langle p_0, p_0 \rangle} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\), \(a_1 = \frac{\langle p_2, p_1 \rangle}{\langle p_1, p_1 \rangle} = \frac{0}{20} = 0\), since \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) are orthogonal.  
5. Thus, the orthogonal projection is \(5p_0 + 0p_1 = 5\), which is verified since \(p_2 - 5p_0\) is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\).  
6. For part (b), we seek \(q = p_2 - \text{proj}_{V}(p_2) = p_2 - 5p_0 = t^2 - 5\), which is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) by construction.  
7. Evaluate \(q\) at \(-3, -1, 1, 3\): \(q(-3) = 9 - 5 = 4\), \(q(-1) = 1 - 5 = -4\), \(q(1) = 1 - 5 = -4\), \(q(3) = 9 - 5 = 4\), so the value vector is \((4, -4, -4, 4)\).  
8. To scale \(q\) so its value vector is \((1, -1, -1, 1)\), divide by 4: \(q_{\text{scaled}}(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t^2 - 5)\).  
9. Final answer: The orthogonal projection of \(p_2\) onto \(\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}\) is \(5\), and the required polynomial is \(q(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t^2 - 5)\).
