1. Write the vectors as columns of a matrix \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\); this step is correct because the span of the vectors is the column space of this matrix.  
2. Perform row reduction to row echelon form to determine linear independence: start by leaving row 1 as is and using it to eliminate below, so row 2 becomes row2 + 3*row1: \((-3)+3*1=0\), \(9+3*(-3)=0\), \((-1)+3*2=5\), \(5+3*(-4)=-7\); row 2 is now \([0, 0, 5, -7]\).  
3. Row 3: row3 - 2*row1: \(2-2*1=0\), \(-6-2*(-3)=0\), \(4-2*2=0\), \(-3-2*(-4)=5\); row 3 is now \([0, 0, 0, 5]\).  
4. Row 4: row4 + 4*row1: \(-4+4*1=0\), \(12+4*(-3)=0\), \(2+4*2=10\), \(7+4*(-4)=-9\); row 4 is now \([0, 0, 10, -9]\).  
5. Now, subtract 2*row2 from row4 to eliminate the third entry: \(10-2*5=0\), \(-9-2*(-7)=5\); row 4 is now \([0, 0, 0, 5]\).  
6. Now, subtract row3 from row4: \([0, 0, 0, 5] - [0, 0, 0, 5] = [0, 0, 0, 0]\); row 4 is now all zeros, confirming redundancy.  
7. The row-reduced matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), which has 3 nonzero rows, so the rank is 3; this means the dimension of the subspace is 3.  
8. The basis consists of the vectors corresponding to the pivot columns, which are \(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4\); verify that \(\mathbf{v}_2\) is a linear combination of these by solving the system, which is consistent with the row reduction.  
9. Final answer: A basis for the subspace is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \}\) and the dimension is 3.
