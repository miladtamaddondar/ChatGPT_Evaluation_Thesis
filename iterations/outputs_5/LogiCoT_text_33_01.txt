1. The matrix \( A \) has 4 rows and 2 columns, so \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix.  
2. The null space \(\text{Nul }A\) consists of all vectors \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), so \(\text{Nul }A\) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).  
3. The column space \(\text{Col }A\) consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so \(\text{Col }A\) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).  
4. Therefore, the answer for part (a) is \( k = 2 \) and for part (b) is \( k = 4 \).
