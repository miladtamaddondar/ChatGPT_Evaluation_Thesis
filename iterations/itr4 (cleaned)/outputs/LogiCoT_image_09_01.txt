1. Write the vectors as columns of a matrix \(A = [\mathbf{v}_1 \ \mathbf{v}_2 \ \mathbf{v}_3 \ \mathbf{v}_4]\): \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\); this step is correct because the span of the vectors is the column space of \(A\).
2. Perform row operations to row reduce \(A\) to echelon form to find the linearly independent columns; this is valid because the pivot columns correspond to a basis for the column space.
3. Use row 1 as the pivot: leave row 1 unchanged, then add 3 times row 1 to row 2, subtract 2 times row 1 from row 3, and add 4 times row 1 to row 4: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 10 & -9 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as each operation eliminates the first entry in rows 2, 3, and 4.
4. Use row 2 as the pivot for column 3: subtract 2 times row 2 from row 4 to eliminate the entry below the pivot: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as it zeros out the entry in row 4, column 3.
5. Observe that row 3 and row 4 are now identical, so subtract row 3 from row 4 to get a zero row: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\); this is correct as it reveals the rank.
6. The echelon form has 3 nonzero rows, so the rank of \(A\) is 3, meaning the dimension of the subspace is 3; this follows from the definition of rank.
7. The pivot columns in the original matrix are columns 1, 3, and 4, so a basis is \(\left\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4 \right\}\); this is correct because these columns are linearly independent and span the subspace.
8. Final answer: The basis for the subspace is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\) and the dimension of the subspace is 3.
