1. Subtract \(\lambda I\) from \(A\) to get \(A - 4I = \begin{bmatrix}3-4 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3-4 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1-4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4-4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct by the definition of the eigenspace.
2. Set up the equation \((A - 4I)\vec{x} = 0\) as \(\begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct since the eigenspace is the null space of \(A-4I\).
3. Write the system of equations: \(-x_1 + 2x_3 = 0\), \(x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 0\), \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0\), \(0 = 0\); this is correct by matrix multiplication.
4. Solve the third equation \(x_2 - 3x_3 = 0 \implies x_2 = 3x_3\); this is correct by basic algebra.
5. Substitute \(x_2 = 3x_3\) into the second equation: \(x_1 - (3x_3) + x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 - 2x_3 = 0 \implies x_1 = 2x_3\); this is correct by substitution and simplification.
6. Substitute \(x_1 = 2x_3\) into the first equation: \(-2x_3 + 2x_3 = 0\), which is always true; this verifies consistency.
7. The variable \(x_4\) does not appear in any equation, so it is free; this is correct since the last column of \(A-4I\) is all zeros.
8. The general solution is \(\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2x_3 \\ 3x_3 \\ x_3 \\ x_4\end{bmatrix} = x_3\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} + x_4\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\); this is correct by expressing the solution in terms of the free variables.
9. Thus, a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda = 4\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct because the vectors are linearly independent and span the solution set.
