1. Substitute \(\lambda = 5\) into \(A - \lambda I\): \(A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix}\).  
2. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of \(A - 5I\), which is \(4 - \text{rank}(A - 5I)\); for a two-dimensional eigenspace, we need \(\text{rank}(A - 5I) = 2\).  
3. Row reduce \(A - 5I\): The last two rows are \([0\ 0\ 0\ 4]\) and \([0\ 0\ 0\ -4]\), which are linearly dependent, so only one contributes to the rank.  
4. The first two rows are \([0\ -2\ 6\ -1]\) and \([0\ -2\ h\ 0]\); subtract the second from the first to get \([0\ 0\ 6-h\ -1]\).  
5. For these two rows to be linearly dependent (so the total rank is 2), set \(6-h = 0\) and \(-1 = 0\), but \(-1 \neq 0\), so instead, ensure the first two rows are linearly dependent: \([0\ -2\ 6\ -1] = k[0\ -2\ h\ 0]\) for some \(k\).  
6. Equate components: \(-2 = -2k\), so \(k = 1\); then \(6 = h\) and \(-1 = 0\), which is impossible, so instead, check if the third and fourth rows can be made linearly dependent with the first two.  
7. The third and fourth rows are already linearly dependent, so focus on the first two rows: their \(2 \times 2\) submatrix \(\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 6 \\ -2 & h \end{bmatrix}\) must be rank 1 for the total rank to be 2.  
8. Compute the determinant: \((-2)h - (-2)6 = -2h + 12\); set this to zero for rank 1: \(-2h + 12 = 0 \implies h = 6\).  
9. Verify: With \(h = 6\), the first two rows become \([0\ -2\ 6\ -1]\) and \([0\ -2\ 6\ 0]\), which are linearly dependent except for the last entry, but the third and fourth rows are still only one rank, so total rank is 2.  
10. Therefore, the value of \(h\) such that the eigenspace for \(\lambda = 5\) is two-dimensional is \(\boxed{6}\).
