1. The matrix \(A\) is already in row echelon form: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & -4 & 2 & -1 & 6 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -3 & 7 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
2. Count the number of pivot columns (columns with leading 1s): There are 3 pivot columns.
3. The dimension of Col \(A\) (the column space) is the rank, which is 3.
4. The dimension of Nul \(A\) (the null space) is the number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = 3\).
5. Final answer: The dimension of Col \(A\) is 3 and the dimension of Nul \(A\) is 3.
