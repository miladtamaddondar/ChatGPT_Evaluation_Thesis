1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. To determine the dimension of \( \text{Col }A \) (the column space), we find the rank of \( A \), which is the number of leading 1s (pivots) in its row-reduced echelon form; from the given matrix, the leading 1s are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so the rank is 3.  
3. The dimension of \( \text{Col }A \) is therefore 3.  
4. To determine the dimension of \( \text{Nul }A \) (the null space), we use the Rank-Nullity Theorem: \(\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = \text{number of columns of }A\), so \(3 + \text{nullity}(A) = 6\).  
5. Solving for nullity, we get \(\text{nullity}(A) = 6 - 3 = 3\).  
6. Final answer: The dimension of \( \text{Nul }A \) is 3 and the dimension of \( \text{Col }A \) is 3.
