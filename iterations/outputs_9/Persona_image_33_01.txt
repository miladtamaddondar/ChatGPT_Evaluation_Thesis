1. The matrix \(A\) is a \(4 \times 2\) matrix, so it has 2 columns and 4 rows.
2. The null space \(\text{Nul }A\) consists of all vectors \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\) such that \(Ax = 0\), so \(\text{Nul }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and thus \(k = 2\) for part (a).
3. The column space \(\text{Col }A\) consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \(A\), which are vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^4\), so \(\text{Col }A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\) and thus \(k = 4\) for part (b).
4. Final answers: (a) \(k = 2\); (b) \(k = 4\).
