1. To find the value of $h$ such that the eigenspace for $\lambda = 5$ is two-dimensional, we first compute $A - 5I$ where $I$ is the $4 \times 4$ identity matrix: $A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix}$.
2. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of $A - 5I$, so we want $\dim(\ker(A-5I)) = 2$; by the rank-nullity theorem, this means the rank of $A-5I$ must be $2$.
3. We row reduce $A-5I$ to determine for which $h$ the rank is $2$: the last two rows can be combined by dividing the last row by $-4$ to get $[0\ 0\ 0\ 1]$, then subtracting $4$ times this row from the third row gives $[0\ 0\ 0\ 0]$ in the third row.
4. After this, the matrix is $\begin{bmatrix}0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, and we see that the first two rows are the only ones that can contribute to the rank in the upper left $2 \times 3$ block.
5. Consider the $2 \times 3$ block: $\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 6 & -1 \\ -2 & h & 0 \end{bmatrix}$; subtract the first row from the second to get $[0, h-6, 1]$ as the new second row.
6. Now, the $2 \times 3$ block is $\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & h-6 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$; this block has rank $2$ unless the second row is a scalar multiple of the first or is zero.
7. The second row $[0, h-6, 1]$ is zero only if $h-6 = 0$ and $1 = 0$, but $1 \neq 0$, so the second row is never zero; for the two rows to be linearly dependent, there must exist $k$ such that $[0, h-6, 1] = k[-2, 6, -1]$, which is only possible if $-2k = 0$ (so $k=0$), but then $h-6 = 0$ and $1 = 0$, which is impossible.
8. Therefore, the upper $2 \times 3$ block always has rank $2$, and with the $[0\ 0\ 0\ 1]$ row, the total rank is $3$ unless the $[0\ 0\ 0\ 1]$ row is eliminated, which happens only if the third and fourth rows are both zero, i.e., $4=0$ and $-4=0$, which is impossible.
9. However, recall that after row operations, the third row becomes zero, so the nonzero rows are the first, second, and fourth, giving rank $3$; to get rank $2$, one of the first two rows must be a linear combination of the other, i.e., the $2 \times 3$ block must have rank $1$.
10. The $2 \times 3$ block has rank $1$ if and only if the second row is a scalar multiple of the first: $[0, h-6, 1] = k[-2, 6, -1]$, which gives $0 = -2k$, so $k=0$, then $h-6 = 0$ and $1 = 0$, which is impossible, so the $2 \times 3$ block always has rank $2$.
11. Therefore, the only way for the rank of $A-5I$ to be $2$ is if the fourth row $[0\ 0\ 0\ 1]$ is eliminated, i.e., the third and fourth rows are both zero, which is not possible unless $4=0$ and $-4=0$; thus, there is a contradiction unless $h$ is chosen so that the second row is a linear combination of the first, i.e., $h-6 = 3 \cdot 1$ (from $[0, h-6, 1] = 3 \cdot [0, 2, -\frac{1}{3}]$), but this is not consistent.
12. Let's instead set $h-6 = 0$ and $1 = 0$, which is impossible, so let's check if $h$ can be chosen so that the two rows are linearly dependent; since this is not possible, let's check the nullity directly: The system $(A-5I)\vec{x} = 0$ gives $-2x_2 + 6x_3 - x_4 = 0$, $-2x_2 + h x_3 = 0$, $4x_4 = 0$, $-4x_4 = 0$.
13. From $4x_4 = 0$ and $-4x_4 = 0$, we get $x_4 = 0$; then, $-2x_2 + 6x_3 = 0$ and $-2x_2 + h x_3 = 0$.
14. Subtracting the two equations: $(-2x_2 + 6x_3) - (-2x_2 + h x_3) = 0 \implies (6 - h)x_3 = 0$.
15. So, if $h \neq 6$, then $x_3 = 0$, and $-2x_2 = 0 \implies x_2 = 0$, so the only free variable is $x_1$, giving a one-dimensional eigenspace.
16. If $h = 6$, then $x_3$ is free, $-2x_2 + 6x_3 = 0 \implies x_2 = 3x_3$, and $x_1$ is also free, so the general solution is $\vec{x} = (x_1, 3x_3, x_3, 0)$, which is two-dimensional.
17. Therefore, the value of $h$ such that the eigenspace for $\lambda = 5$ is two-dimensional is $h = 6$.
