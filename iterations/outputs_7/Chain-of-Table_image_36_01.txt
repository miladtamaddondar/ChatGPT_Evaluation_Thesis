1. The matrix \(A\) is already in row echelon form: \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & -4 & 2 & -1 & 6 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -3 & 7 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).  
2. The number of pivots (leading 1s) is 3, so the rank of \(A\) is 3.  
3. The dimension of \(\text{Col}\,A\) is the rank: \(\boxed{3}\).  
4. The dimension of \(\text{Nul}\,A\) is the number of columns minus the rank: \(6 - 3 = \boxed{3}\).  
5. Final answer: The dimension of \(\text{Col}\,A\) is \(3\) and the dimension of \(\text{Nul}\,A\) is \(3\).
