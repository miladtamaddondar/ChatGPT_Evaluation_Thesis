1. Let the unknown matrix be \( A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix} \), and recall that matrix multiplication gives \( A\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 \\ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 \\ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 \end{bmatrix} \), which must equal \( \begin{bmatrix} 3x_1 - 2x_3 \\ 4x_1 \\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \end{bmatrix} \) for all \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \).
2. By equating the first row: \( a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 3x_1 - 2x_3 \), so by comparing coefficients, \( a_{11} = 3 \), \( a_{12} = 0 \), \( a_{13} = -2 \); this is valid since the equation must hold for all \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \).
3. By equating the second row: \( a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 4x_1 \), so \( a_{21} = 4 \), \( a_{22} = 0 \), \( a_{23} = 0 \); this is valid since only \( x_1 \) appears on the right.
4. By equating the third row: \( a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \), so \( a_{31} = 1 \), \( a_{32} = -1 \), \( a_{33} = 1 \); this is valid as each coefficient matches the corresponding variable.
5. The completed matrix is \( \boxed{\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & -2 \\ 4 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}} \), which satisfies the original equation for all \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) by construction.
