1. The matrix \(A\) is a \(4 \times 6\) matrix because it has 4 rows and 6 columns. 2. The dimension of \(\text{Col}\,A\) is the rank of \(A\), which is the number of pivot columns in its row echelon form; from the matrix, there are 3 nonzero rows, so \(\text{rank}(A) = 3\). 3. The dimension of \(\text{Nul}\,A\) is given by the number of free variables, which is the total number of columns minus the rank: \(\dim(\text{Nul}\,A) = 6 - 3 = 3\). 4. Final answer: \(\dim(\text{Col}\,A) = 3\), \(\dim(\text{Nul}\,A) = 3\).
