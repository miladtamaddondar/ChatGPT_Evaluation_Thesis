1. For part (a), the null space Nul \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), where \(k\) is the number of columns of \(A\). Here, \(A\) is a \(4 \times 2\) matrix, so \(k = 2\).  
2. For part (b), the column space Col \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^k\), where \(k\) is the number of rows of \(A\). Here, \(A\) is a \(4 \times 2\) matrix, so \(k = 4\).  
3. Final answer: (a) \(k = 2\) for Nul \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\); (b) \(k = 4\) for Col \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\).
