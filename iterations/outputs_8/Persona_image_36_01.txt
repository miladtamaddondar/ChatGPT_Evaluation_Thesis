1. The matrix \(A\) has 4 rows and 6 columns, so it is a \(4 \times 6\) matrix.  
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1s in reduced row echelon form) is 3, as seen in columns 1, 3, and 4.  
3. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) (column space) is the number of pivot columns, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).  
4. The dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) (null space) is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the number of pivots, so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6 - 3 = 3\).  
5. Final answer: \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\), \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\).
