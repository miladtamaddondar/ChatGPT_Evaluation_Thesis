1. Observe that $A$ is a $4 \times 6$ matrix, so its null space is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^6$ and its column space is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$.
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1s in each row) in $A$ is equal to the rank of $A$; from the matrix, the pivots are in columns 1, 3, and 4, so $\operatorname{rank}(A) = 3$.
3. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, $\operatorname{rank}(A) + \dim(\operatorname{Nul} A) = 6$, so $\dim(\operatorname{Nul} A) = 6 - 3 = 3$.
4. The dimension of the column space of $A$ is equal to the rank, so $\dim(\operatorname{Col} A) = 3$.
5. Final answer: $\dim(\operatorname{Nul} A) = 3$ and $\dim(\operatorname{Col} A) = 3$.
