1. The standard basis for \(\mathbb{P}_2\) is \(\{1, t, t^2\}\), and the given basis is \(\mathcal{B} = \{1 - 3t^2, 2 + t - 5t^2, 1 + 2t\}\); to find the change-of-coordinates matrix from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the standard basis, express each \(\mathcal{B}\) vector in standard coordinates.  
2. Write \(1 - 3t^2\) as \((1, 0, -3)\) in the standard basis, \(2 + t - 5t^2\) as \((2, 1, -5)\), and \(1 + 2t\) as \((1, 2, 0)\); verify by matching coefficients with \(a_0 + a_1 t + a_2 t^2\).  
3. The change-of-coordinates matrix \(P\) from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the standard basis is formed by these coordinate columns: \(P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\); verify by checking that multiplying \(P\) by \(\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3 \end{bmatrix}\) gives the corresponding linear combination in the standard basis.  
4. To write \(t^2\) as a linear combination of the polynomials in \(\mathcal{B}\), set \(t^2 = a(1 - 3t^2) + b(2 + t - 5t^2) + c(1 + 2t)\) and expand: \(t^2 = (a + 2b + c) + (b + 2c)t + (-3a - 5b)t^2\).  
5. Match coefficients with \(t^2 = 0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot t + 1 \cdot t^2\), resulting in the system: \(a + 2b + c = 0\), \(b + 2c = 0\), \(-3a - 5b = 1\).  
6. Solve \(b + 2c = 0\) to get \(b = -2c\); substitute into the other equations: \(a + 2(-2c) + c = 0 \implies a - 4c + c = 0 \implies a = 3c\), and \(-3a - 5b = 1 \implies -3(3c) - 5(-2c) = 1 \implies -9c + 10c = 1 \implies c = 1\).  
7. Substitute \(c = 1\) to get \(a = 3\), \(b = -2\); verify by plugging back: \(a + 2b + c = 3 + 2(-2) + 1 = 0\), \(b + 2c = -2 + 2 = 0\), \(-3a - 5b = -9 + 10 = 1\).  
8. The coordinates of \(t^2\) in \(\mathcal{B}\) are \(\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), so \(t^2 = 3(1 - 3t^2) - 2(2 + t - 5t^2) + 1(1 + 2t)\) as a linear combination of the polynomials in \(\mathcal{B}\).
