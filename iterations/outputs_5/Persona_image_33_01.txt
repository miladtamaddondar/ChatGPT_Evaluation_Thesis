1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix, so it has 2 columns and 4 rows.
2. The null space of \( A \), \( \text{Nul } A \), consists of all vectors \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \).
3. Therefore, \( \text{Nul } A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), so for part (a), \( k = 2 \).
4. The column space of \( A \), \( \text{Col } A \), consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).
5. Therefore, \( \text{Col } A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so for part (b), \( k = 4 \).
6. Final answers: (a) \( k = 2 \), (b) \( k = 4 \).
