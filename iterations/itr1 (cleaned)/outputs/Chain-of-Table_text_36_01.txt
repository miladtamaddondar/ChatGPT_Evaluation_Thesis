1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so the number of columns is 6 and the number of rows is 4.  
2. The number of pivot columns (leading 1s in the row-echelon form) is 3, as seen in columns 1, 3, and 4.  
3. The dimension of \( \text{Col }A \) is the number of pivot columns, so \( \dim(\text{Col }A) = 3 \).  
4. The dimension of \( \text{Nul }A \) is the number of free variables, which is the number of columns minus the number of pivot columns: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \), so \( \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3 \).
