1. Write the transformation equations: \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, 4x_1 + 5x_2) \) and set \( (x_1 + x_2, 4x_1 + 5x_2) = (3, 8) \).  
2. Set up the system of equations: \( x_1 + x_2 = 3 \) and \( 4x_1 + 5x_2 = 8 \).  
3. Solve the first equation for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \).  
4. Substitute \( x_1 \) into the second equation: \( 4(3 - x_2) + 5x_2 = 8 \).  
5. Expand and simplify: \( 12 - 4x_2 + 5x_2 = 8 \) gives \( 12 + x_2 = 8 \).  
6. Solve for \( x_2 \): \( x_2 = 8 - 12 = -4 \).  
7. Substitute \( x_2 = -4 \) into \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \): \( x_1 = 3 - (-4) = 7 \).  
8. Verify by plugging \( x_1 = 7 \), \( x_2 = -4 \) into the original transformation: \( (7 + (-4), 4 \cdot 7 + 5 \cdot (-4)) = (3, 28 - 20) = (3, 8) \), which matches the target.  
9. Final answer: The solution is \( \mathbf{x} = (7, -4) \).
