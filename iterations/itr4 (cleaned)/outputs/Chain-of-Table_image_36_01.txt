1. The matrix \(A\) is already in row echelon form: \(\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}1 & 3 & -4 & 2 & -1 & 6 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -3 & 7 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right]\). There are 3 nonzero rows, so the rank of \(A\) is 3.
2. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) (the column space) is the rank, which is 3.
3. The number of columns is 6, so the dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) (the null space) is \(6 - 3 = 3\).
4. Final answer: The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) is 3 and the dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) is 3.
