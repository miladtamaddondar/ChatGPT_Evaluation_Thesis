1. The matrix $A$ is a $4 \times 6$ matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. The rank of $A$ is the number of leading 1's in its row-reduced echelon form; from the matrix, there are 3 nonzero rows, so $\operatorname{rank} A = 3$.  
3. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, $\operatorname{rank} A + \dim \operatorname{Nul} A = $ number of columns $= 6$, so $\dim \operatorname{Nul} A = 6 - 3 = 3$.  
4. The dimension of $\operatorname{Col} A$ is equal to the rank of $A$, so $\dim \operatorname{Col} A = 3$.  
5. Final answer: $\boxed{\dim \operatorname{Nul} A = 3 \text{ and } \dim \operatorname{Col} A = 3}$.
