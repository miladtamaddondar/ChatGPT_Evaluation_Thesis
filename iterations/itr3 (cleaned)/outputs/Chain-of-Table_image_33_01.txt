1. The matrix \( A \) is given as \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \), which is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix. 
2. The null space of \( A \), \(\text{Nul }A\), consists of all vectors \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), so it is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), thus \( k = 2 \) for part (a). 
3. The column space of \( A \), \(\text{Col }A\), consists of all linear combinations of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so it is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), thus \( k = 4 \) for part (b).
