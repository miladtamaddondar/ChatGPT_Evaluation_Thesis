1. We are given the linear transformation \( T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 \) defined by \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, 4x_1 + 5x_2) \) and need to find \( (x_1, x_2) \) such that \( T(x_1, x_2) = (3, 8) \). 2. Set up the system of equations: \( x_1 + x_2 = 3 \) and \( 4x_1 + 5x_2 = 8 \). 3. Solve the first equation for \( x_1 \): \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \). 4. Substitute \( x_1 \) into the second equation: \( 4(3 - x_2) + 5x_2 = 8 \). 5. Expand and simplify: \( 12 - 4x_2 + 5x_2 = 8 \) gives \( 12 + x_2 = 8 \). 6. Solve for \( x_2 \): \( x_2 = 8 - 12 = -4 \). 7. Substitute \( x_2 = -4 \) back into \( x_1 = 3 - x_2 \): \( x_1 = 3 - (-4) = 7 \). 8. Therefore, the solution is \( \mathbf{x} = (7, -4) \).
