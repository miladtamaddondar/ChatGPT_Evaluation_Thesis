1. The matrix given is \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \).  
2. (a) The null space Nul \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \(n\) is the number of columns of \(A\). Here, \(A\) has 2 columns, so \(k = 2\).  
3. (b) The column space Col \(A\) is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \(m\) is the number of rows of \(A\). Here, \(A\) has 4 rows, so \(k = 4\).  
4. Final answer: (a) \(k = 2\) for Nul \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\); (b) \(k = 4\) for Col \(A\) as a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\).
