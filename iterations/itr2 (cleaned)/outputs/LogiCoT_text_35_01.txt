1. Express $p(t) = 1 + 4t + 7t^2$ as a linear combination of the basis elements: $p(t) = a(1 + t^2) + b(t + t^2) + c(1 + 2t + t^2)$.  
2. Expand the right-hand side: $a(1 + t^2) + b(t + t^2) + c(1 + 2t + t^2) = a + a t^2 + b t + b t^2 + c + 2c t + c t^2$.  
3. Combine like terms: $(a + c) + (b + 2c)t + (a + b + c)t^2$.  
4. Set up the system of equations by equating coefficients with $p(t)$: $a + c = 1$, $b + 2c = 4$, $a + b + c = 7$.  
5. Verify the system is consistent and has a unique solution by noting the basis is linearly independent (since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{P}_2$).  
6. Solve for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$ using the first two equations: $a = 1 - c$, $b = 4 - 2c$.  
7. Substitute $a$ and $b$ into the third equation: $(1 - c) + (4 - 2c) + c = 7$.  
8. Simplify: $1 - c + 4 - 2c + c = 7 \implies 5 - 2c = 7$.  
9. Solve for $c$: $-2c = 2 \implies c = -1$.  
10. Substitute $c = -1$ into $a = 1 - c$ and $b = 4 - 2c$: $a = 1 - (-1) = 2$, $b = 4 - 2(-1) = 6$.  
11. The coordinate vector of $p(t)$ relative to $\mathcal{B}$ is $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$.  
12. Verify by reconstructing $p(t)$: $2(1 + t^2) + 6(t + t^2) - 1(1 + 2t + t^2) = (2 - 1) + (6 - 2) t + (2 + 6 - 1) t^2 = 1 + 4t + 7t^2$, confirming the solution is correct.
