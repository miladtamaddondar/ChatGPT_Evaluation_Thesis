1. The matrix \( A \) is given as \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -6 \\ -1 & 3 \\ -4 & 12 \\ 3 & -9 \end{bmatrix} \), which has 4 rows and 2 columns. 2. The null space of \( A \), \(\text{Nul }A\), is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), where \( n \) is the number of columns of \( A \), so for part (a), \( k = 2 \). 3. The column space of \( A \), \(\text{Col }A\), is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), where \( m \) is the number of rows of \( A \), so for part (b), \( k = 4 \).
