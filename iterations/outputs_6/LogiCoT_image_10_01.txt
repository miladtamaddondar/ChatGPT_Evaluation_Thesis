1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this is correct as echelon form has zeros below each leading entry.  
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4, since those columns contain the leading entries (first nonzero in each row); this is correct by the definition of pivot columns.  
3. The basis for \(\text{Col }A\) is formed by the corresponding columns of \(A\): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct as the pivot columns of \(A\) form a basis for the column space.  
4. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) is 3, since there are 3 pivot columns; this is correct by the rank theorem.  
5. To find a basis for \(\text{Nul }A\), set up the equation \(A\vec{x} = 0\) and use the echelon form to solve for the free variable(s); since there are 4 columns and 3 pivots, there is 1 free variable.  
6. Let \(x_2\) be the free variable; from the last nonzero row, \(5x_4 = 0 \implies x_4 = 0\), from the second row, \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0\), and from the first row, \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0 \implies x_1 = 3x_2\); this is correct by back substitution.  
7. The general solution to \(A\vec{x} = 0\) is \(\vec{x} = x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), so a basis for \(\text{Nul }A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct as each free variable gives a basis vector.  
8. The dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) is 1, since there is 1 free variable; this is correct by the rank-nullity theorem.
