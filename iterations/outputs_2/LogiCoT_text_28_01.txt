1. Express the linear transformation $T(\mathbf{x})$ as $T(\mathbf{x}) = x_1\mathbf{v}_1 + x_2\mathbf{v}_2 = x_1 \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix} + x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct by the definition of $T$ as a linear combination of $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$.
2. Combine the vectors to write $T(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix} -2x_1 + 7x_2 \\ 5x_1 - 3x_2 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct by the distributive property of matrix addition and scalar multiplication.
3. Write $T(\mathbf{x})$ as a matrix-vector product: $T(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 7 \\ 5 & -3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct since multiplying the matrix by the vector yields the same linear combination as above.
4. Conclude that the matrix $A$ such that $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$ is $A = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 7 \\ 5 & -3 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct because the columns of $A$ are $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ respectively.
