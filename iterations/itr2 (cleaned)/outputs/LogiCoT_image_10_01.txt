1. The given matrix is \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix} \) and its echelon form is \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \); this echelon form is correct as each leading entry is to the right of the leading entry in the row above and all rows of zeros are at the bottom. 
2. The pivot columns in the echelon form are columns 1, 3, and 4, so the basis for \(\operatorname{Col} A\) is given by the corresponding columns of \(A\): \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct by the definition of the column space basis. 
3. The dimension of \(\operatorname{Col} A\) is the number of pivot columns, which is 3; this is correct by the rank theorem. 
4. To find a basis for \(\operatorname{Nul} A\), set up the homogeneous system using the echelon form: \(x_1 - 3x_2 + 2x_3 - 4x_4 = 0\), \(5x_3 - 7x_4 = 0\), \(5x_4 = 0\); this setup is correct as it follows from the row-reduced system. 
5. From the last equation, \(x_4 = 0\); from the second, \(x_3 = 0\); substitute into the first to get \(x_1 - 3x_2 = 0\), so \(x_1 = 3x_2\); this back-substitution is correct. 
6. Letting \(x_2 = t\), the general solution is \(\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{bmatrix} = t \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\), so a basis for \(\operatorname{Nul} A\) is \(\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right\}\); this is correct as it spans the null space. 
7. The dimension of \(\operatorname{Nul} A\) is 1, as there is one free variable; this is correct by the rank-nullity theorem since \(4 - 3 = 1\).
