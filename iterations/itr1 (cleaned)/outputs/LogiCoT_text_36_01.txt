1. Identify the size of matrix \(A\): \(A\) is a \(4 \times 6\) matrix because it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. Find the number of pivot columns (rank): The matrix is in row-echelon form, and there are leading ones in columns 1, 3, and 4, so the rank of \(A\) is 3.  
3. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, \(\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = \text{number of columns}\), so \(3 + \text{nullity}(A) = 6\).  
4. Solve for \(\text{nullity}(A)\): \(\text{nullity}(A) = 6 - 3 = 3\).  
5. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) is the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).  
6. The dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\) is the nullity, so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\).  
7. Final answer: \(\boxed{\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3, \ \dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3}\).
