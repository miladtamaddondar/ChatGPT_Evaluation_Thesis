Let's solve part (a) step by step:

1. The inner product is defined as \(\langle f, g \rangle = f(-3)g(-3) + f(-1)g(-1) + f(1)g(1) + f(3)g(3)\); verify: this is a valid inner product as it is a weighted sum of pointwise products at four points.  
2. The orthogonal projection of \(p_2\) onto \(\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}\) is given by \(\text{proj}_{W}(p_2) = a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1\), where \(a_0, a_1\) are chosen so that \(p_2 - (a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1)\) is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\).  
3. Set up the orthogonality conditions: \(\langle p_2 - (a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1), p_0 \rangle = 0\) and \(\langle p_2 - (a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1), p_1 \rangle = 0\); this leads to two equations: \(\langle p_2, p_0 \rangle = a_0 \langle p_0, p_0 \rangle + a_1 \langle p_1, p_0 \rangle\) and \(\langle p_2, p_1 \rangle = a_0 \langle p_0, p_1 \rangle + a_1 \langle p_1, p_1 \rangle\).  
4. Compute the necessary inner products: \(p_0(t) = 1\), so \(\langle p_0, p_0 \rangle = 1+1+1+1=4\); \(p_1(t) = t\), so \(\langle p_1, p_0 \rangle = (-3)+(-1)+1+3=0\); \(\langle p_1, p_1 \rangle = (-3)^2+(-1)^2+1^2+3^2=9+1+1+9=20\); \(p_2(t) = t^2\), so \(\langle p_2, p_0 \rangle = 9+1+1+9=20\); \(\langle p_2, p_1 \rangle = 9\cdot(-3)+1\cdot(-1)+1\cdot1+9\cdot3 = -27-1+1+27=0\).  
5. Substitute into the equations: From above, \(\langle p_2, p_0 \rangle = 20\), \(\langle p_2, p_1 \rangle = 0\), \(\langle p_0, p_0 \rangle = 4\), \(\langle p_1, p_0 \rangle = 0\), \(\langle p_1, p_1 \rangle = 20\), \(\langle p_0, p_1 \rangle = 0\); so the equations are \(20 = 4a_0 + 0a_1\) and \(0 = 0a_0 + 20a_1\).  
6. Solve for \(a_0, a_1\): From the first equation, \(a_0 = 5\); from the second, \(a_1 = 0\).  
7. Therefore, the orthogonal projection is \(\text{proj}_{W}(p_2) = 5p_0 + 0p_1 = 5\cdot 1 = 5\); verify: \(p_2 - 5p_0 = t^2 - 5\) is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) as shown by the zero inner products above.  

Now part (b):

8. Let \(q(t) = p_2(t) - \text{proj}_{W}(p_2) = t^2 - 5\); verify: \(\langle q, p_0 \rangle = \langle t^2 - 5, 1 \rangle = 20 - 20 = 0\), \(\langle q, p_1 \rangle = \langle t^2 - 5, t \rangle = 0 - 0 = 0\), so \(q\) is orthogonal to both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\).  
9. Evaluate \(q\) at \(-3, -1, 1, 3\): \(q(-3) = 9-5=4\), \(q(-1)=1-5=-4\), \(q(1)=1-5=-4\), \(q(3)=9-5=4\); so the vector is \((4, -4, -4, 4)\).  
10. To scale \(q\) so that its values at \((-3, -1, 1, 3)\) are \((1, -1, -1, 1)\), divide by 4: \(\tilde{q}(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t^2 - 5)\); verify: \(\tilde{q}(-3) = 1\), \(\tilde{q}(-1) = -1\), \(\tilde{q}(1) = -1\), \(\tilde{q}(3) = 1\), as required.  

Final answer: 11. The orthogonal projection of \(p_2\) onto \(\text{span}\{p_0, p_1\}\) is \(5\), and the required polynomial is \(\boxed{\tilde{q}(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t^2 - 5)}\).
