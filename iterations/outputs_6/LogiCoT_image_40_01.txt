1. The standard basis for \(\mathbb{P}_2\) is \(\{1, t, t^2\}\), and the given basis is \(\mathcal{B} = \{1 - 3t^2, 2 + t - 5t^2, 1 + 2t\}\); to find the change-of-coordinates matrix from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the standard basis, we write each vector in \(\mathcal{B}\) as a coordinate vector relative to the standard basis.  
2. The first basis vector \(1 - 3t^2\) has coordinates \((1, 0, -3)\) since it is \(1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot t + (-3) \cdot t^2\); this is verified by matching coefficients.  
3. The second basis vector \(2 + t - 5t^2\) has coordinates \((2, 1, -5)\) since it is \(2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot t + (-5) \cdot t^2\); this is verified by matching coefficients.  
4. The third basis vector \(1 + 2t\) has coordinates \((1, 2, 0)\) since it is \(1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot t + 0 \cdot t^2\); this is verified by matching coefficients.  
5. The change-of-coordinates matrix from \(\mathcal{B}\) to the standard basis is formed by placing these coordinate vectors as columns: \[ P_{\mathcal{B} \to \text{std}} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \]  
6. To write \(t^2\) as a linear combination of the polynomials in \(\mathcal{B}\), we seek scalars \(a, b, c\) such that \(t^2 = a(1 - 3t^2) + b(2 + t - 5t^2) + c(1 + 2t)\); this is verified by expanding and equating coefficients.  
7. Expanding, we get \(t^2 = a(1 - 3t^2) + b(2 + t - 5t^2) + c(1 + 2t) = (a + 2b + c) + (b + 2c)t + (-3a - 5b)t^2\); this is verified by collecting like terms.  
8. Equate coefficients with \(t^2 = 0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot t + 1 \cdot t^2\): \(a + 2b + c = 0\), \(b + 2c = 0\), \(-3a - 5b = 1\); this is verified by matching coefficients for each power of \(t\).  
9. Solve \(b + 2c = 0 \implies b = -2c\); substitute into the other equations: \(a + 2(-2c) + c = 0 \implies a - 4c + c = 0 \implies a = 3c\).  
10. Substitute \(a = 3c\) and \(b = -2c\) into \(-3a - 5b = 1\): \(-3(3c) - 5(-2c) = 1 \implies -9c + 10c = 1 \implies c = 1\).  
11. Then \(b = -2c = -2\) and \(a = 3c = 3\); thus, the coordinates of \(t^2\) in \(\mathcal{B}\) are \(\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), which is verified by plugging back into the equations.  
12. Final answer: The change-of-coordinates matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(t^2 = 3(1 - 3t^2) - 2(2 + t - 5t^2) + 1(1 + 2t)\) as a linear combination of the polynomials in \(\mathcal{B}\).
