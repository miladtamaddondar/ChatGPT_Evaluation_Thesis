1. The matrix \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p]\) consists of the vectors \(Qr_1, Qr_2, \ldots, Qr_p\) as its columns. 
2. Notice that each \(Qr_j\) is the result of multiplying \(Q\) (an \(m \times n\) matrix) by \(r_j\) (an \(n \times 1\) vector), so we can write the entire matrix as \(Q\) times another matrix whose columns are \(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_p\). 
3. Let \(R = [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\), which is an \(n \times p\) matrix formed by stacking the vectors \(r_j\) as columns. 
4. Therefore, \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p] = Q R\). 
5. Final answer: \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q R\), where \(Q\) is \(m \times n\) and \(R\) is \(n \times p\).
