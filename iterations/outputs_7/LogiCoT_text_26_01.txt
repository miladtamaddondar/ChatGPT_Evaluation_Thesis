1. To show $T$ is a linear transformation, we seek a matrix $A$ such that $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$ for all $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T$.
2. The first component of $T(\mathbf{x})$ is $0$, which can be written as $0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 + 0x_4$, so the first row of $A$ is $(0, 0, 0, 0)$.
3. The second component is $x_1 + x_2$, which corresponds to the row $(1, 1, 0, 0)$ in $A$.
4. The third component is $x_2 + x_3$, which corresponds to the row $(0, 1, 1, 0)$ in $A$.
5. The fourth component is $x_3 + x_4$, which corresponds to the row $(0, 0, 1, 1)$ in $A$.
6. Therefore, the matrix $A$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
7. Verification: Multiplying $A$ by $\mathbf{x}$ yields $(0, x_1 + x_2, x_2 + x_3, x_3 + x_4)^T$, matching $T(\mathbf{x})$.
8. Final answer: $T$ is a linear transformation and is implemented by the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
