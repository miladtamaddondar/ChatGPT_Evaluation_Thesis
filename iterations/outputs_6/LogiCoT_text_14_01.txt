1. To find $h$ such that the eigenspace for $\lambda=5$ is two-dimensional, we first compute $A - 5I$: $A - 5I = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \end{bmatrix}$.
2. The eigenspace dimension is the nullity of $A-5I$, so we need $\text{nullity}(A-5I) = 2$; by the rank-nullity theorem, this means $\text{rank}(A-5I) = 2$ because the matrix is $4 \times 4$.
3. To find the rank, observe that the last two rows are $[0,0,0,4]$ and $[0,0,0,-4]$, which are linearly dependent, so at most one contributes to the rank; verify: subtracting row 4 from row 3 gives $[0,0,0,8]$, so only one is independent.
4. Focus on the upper $2 \times 4$ block: $\begin{bmatrix}0 & -2 & 6 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & h & 0\end{bmatrix}$; subtract row 1 from row 2 (after multiplying row 1 by $1$ to align the $-2$ entries): row 2 minus row 1 gives $[0,0,h-6,1]$.
5. Now, the first nonzero entry in row 1 is $-2$ in column 2, and in row 2 (after elimination) is $h-6$ in column 3 (if $h \neq 6$); so if $h \neq 6$, both rows are independent, giving two independent rows in the upper block.
6. Including one independent row from the lower block, the total rank is $2+1=3$ if $h \neq 6$; but we need rank $2$, so set $h-6=0$, i.e., $h=6$.
7. Verify: for $h=6$, the upper block becomes two identical rows $[0,-2,6,0]$, so only one is independent; with one from the lower block, total rank is $2$.
8. Therefore, the value of $h$ such that the eigenspace for $\lambda=5$ is two-dimensional is $h=6$.
