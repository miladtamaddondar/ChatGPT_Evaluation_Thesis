1. Write the transformation equations and set them equal to the given vector: \(T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2x_2, -x_1 + 3x_2, 3x_1 - 2x_2) = (-1, 4, 9)\).
2. Set up the system of equations: \(x_1 - 2x_2 = -1\), \(-x_1 + 3x_2 = 4\), \(3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9\).
3. Solve the first equation for \(x_1\): \(x_1 = -1 + 2x_2\).
4. Substitute \(x_1\) into the second equation: \(-(-1 + 2x_2) + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 - 2x_2 + 3x_2 = 4 \implies 1 + x_2 = 4\).
5. Solve for \(x_2\): \(x_2 = 4 - 1 = 3\).
6. Substitute \(x_2 = 3\) into the expression for \(x_1\): \(x_1 = -1 + 2 \times 3 = -1 + 6 = 5\).
7. Check the solution in the third equation: \(3x_1 - 2x_2 = 3 \times 5 - 2 \times 3 = 15 - 6 = 9\), which is correct.
8. Final answer: The vector \(\mathbf{x}\) such that \(T(\mathbf{x}) = (-1, 4, 9)\) is \(\boxed{(5, 3)}\).
