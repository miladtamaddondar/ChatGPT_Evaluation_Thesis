1. Write the general form of vectors in \( W \): Any vector in \( W \) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix}\) where \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \). 2. Check if \( W \) is closed under addition: Let \(\vec{u} = \begin{bmatrix} 3a_1 + b_1 \\ 4 \\ a_1 - 5b_1 \end{bmatrix}\), \(\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3a_2 + b_2 \\ 4 \\ a_2 - 5b_2 \end{bmatrix}\), then \(\vec{u} + \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3(a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2) \\ 8 \\ (a_1 + a_2) - 5(b_1 + b_2) \end{bmatrix}\). 3. Notice the second component: The sum is 8, not 4, so \( W \) is not closed under addition. 4. Conclusion: \( W \) is not a vector space because it is not closed under addition.
