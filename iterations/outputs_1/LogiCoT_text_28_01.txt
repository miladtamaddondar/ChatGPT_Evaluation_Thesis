1. Express the linear transformation $T$ as $T(\mathbf{x}) = x_1\mathbf{v}_1 + x_2\mathbf{v}_2 = x_1\begin{bmatrix}-2 \\ 5\end{bmatrix} + x_2\begin{bmatrix}7 \\ -3\end{bmatrix}$, which is correct by the definition of $T$.  
2. Write $T(\mathbf{x})$ as a matrix-vector product: $T(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}-2 & 7 \\ 5 & -3\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}$, which is valid since multiplying the matrix by the vector yields the same linear combination as in step 1.  
3. Conclude that the matrix $A$ such that $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$ is $A = \begin{bmatrix}-2 & 7 \\ 5 & -3\end{bmatrix}$, which is verified by checking that the columns of $A$ are $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ respectively.
