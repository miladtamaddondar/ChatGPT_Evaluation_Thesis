1. To show $T$ is linear, we need to find a matrix $A$ such that $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$ for all $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T$.
2. The output vector is $(0, x_1 + x_2, x_2 + x_3, x_3 + x_4)$, so we write this as a matrix-vector product.
3. The first entry is always $0$, so the first row of $A$ is $(0, 0, 0, 0)$.
4. The second entry is $x_1 + x_2$, so the second row of $A$ is $(1, 1, 0, 0)$.
5. The third entry is $x_2 + x_3$, so the third row of $A$ is $(0, 1, 1, 0)$.
6. The fourth entry is $x_3 + x_4$, so the fourth row of $A$ is $(0, 0, 1, 1)$.
7. Thus, the matrix $A$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
8. Therefore, $T$ is a linear transformation and is implemented by the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
