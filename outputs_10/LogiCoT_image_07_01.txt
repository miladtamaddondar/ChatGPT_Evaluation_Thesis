1. Recognize that \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p]\) is a matrix whose columns are \(Q r_1, Q r_2, \ldots, Q r_p\), where each \(r_j\) is a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and \(Q\) is an \(m \times n\) matrix. 2. Observe that multiplying \(Q\) by the matrix \([r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\) (which is \(n \times p\)) produces the matrix \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p]\) by the rules of matrix multiplication. 3. Thus, \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\), which is a product of two matrices, neither of which is the identity matrix. 4. Verification: By the definition of matrix multiplication, the \(j\)-th column of \(Q [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\) is \(Q r_j\), matching the original matrix, so the step is correct. 5. Final answer: \([Qr_1 \ Qr_2 \ \ldots \ Qr_p] = Q [r_1 \ r_2 \ \ldots \ r_p]\).
