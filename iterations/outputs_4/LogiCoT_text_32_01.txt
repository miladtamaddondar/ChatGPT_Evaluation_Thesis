1. To determine if $\mathbf{w}$ is in $\text{Nul }A$, check if $A\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$ by computing the matrix-vector product.  
2. Compute the first entry: $3(1) + (-5)(3) + (-3)(-4) = 3 - 15 + 12 = 0$; since $0$ is obtained, the first entry is correct.  
3. Compute the second entry: $6(1) + (-2)(3) + 0(-4) = 6 - 6 + 0 = 0$; since $0$ is obtained, the second entry is correct.  
4. Compute the third entry: $-8(1) + 4(3) + 1(-4) = -8 + 12 - 4 = 0$; since $0$ is obtained, the third entry is correct.  
5. Since $A\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$, $\mathbf{w}$ is in $\text{Nul }A$.
