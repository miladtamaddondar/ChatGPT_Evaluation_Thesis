1. Write the equation $T(\mathbf{x}) = (-1, 4, 9)$ in terms of components: $T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2x_2, -x_1 + 3x_2, 3x_1 - 2x_2) = (-1, 4, 9)$.
2. Set up the system of equations: $x_1 - 2x_2 = -1$, $-x_1 + 3x_2 = 4$, $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9$.
3. Verify that the system is consistent by checking if the equations are compatible; use the first two equations to solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$.
4. Add the first and second equations: $(x_1 - 2x_2) + (-x_1 + 3x_2) = -1 + 4 \implies x_2 = 3$.
5. Substitute $x_2 = 3$ into the first equation: $x_1 - 2(3) = -1 \implies x_1 - 6 = -1 \implies x_1 = 5$.
6. Verify the solution in the third equation: $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 3(5) - 2(3) = 15 - 6 = 9$, which matches the right-hand side.
7. Conclude that the solution is $\mathbf{x} = (5, 3)$.
