1. Write the vectors as columns of a matrix \(A = [\mathbf{v}_1\ \mathbf{v}_2\ \mathbf{v}_3\ \mathbf{v}_4]\): \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ -3 & 9 & -1 & 5 \\ 2 & -6 & 4 & -3 \\ -4 & 12 & 2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\).  
2. Use row reduction to determine linear independence: Start with the first column as the pivot and eliminate below; add 3 times row 1 to row 2: new row 2 is \([0, 0, 5, -7]\).  
3. Eliminate below in column 1 for row 3: row 3 - 2*row 1 gives new row 3 as \([0, 0, 0, 5]\).  
4. Eliminate below in column 1 for row 4: row 4 + 4*row 1 gives new row 4 as \([0, 0, 10, 23]\).  
5. The matrix is now \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 10 & 23 \end{bmatrix}\); next, eliminate below in column 3: row 4 - 2*row 3 gives new row 4 as \([0, 0, 10-2*0, 23-2*5] = [0, 0, 10, 13]\).  
6. Now, row 4 - 2*row 2 (from earlier step) gives row 4 as \([0, 0, 10-2*5, 13-2*(-7)] = [0, 0, 0, 27]\).  
7. The row-reduced matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 & -4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & -7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 27 \end{bmatrix}\), which has 4 leading entries (pivots).  
8. Since there are 4 pivots, the original vectors are linearly independent and form a basis.  
9. The basis for the subspace is \(\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4\}\).  
10. The dimension of the subspace is 4.
