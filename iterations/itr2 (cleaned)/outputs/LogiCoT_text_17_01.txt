1. To find the image under $T$ of $p(t) = 5 + 3t$, evaluate $p(-1)$, $p(0)$, and $p(1)$: $p(-1) = 5 + 3(-1) = 2$, $p(0) = 5 + 3(0) = 5$, $p(1) = 5 + 3(1) = 8$.  
2. Therefore, $T(p) = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$, which is correct since each component matches the evaluation of $p(t)$ at $t = -1, 0, 1$.  
3. To find the matrix for $T$ relative to the basis $\{1, t, t^2\}$ for $\mathbb{P}_2$ and the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$, first compute $T(1)$, $T(t)$, and $T(t^2)$: $T(1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$, $T(t) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$, $T(t^2) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.  
4. The matrix for $T$ is formed by placing these vectors as columns: $[T] = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, which is verified by checking that $T(a + bt + ct^2) = aT(1) + bT(t) + cT(t^2)$ matches the action of $T$ on any $p(t)$.
