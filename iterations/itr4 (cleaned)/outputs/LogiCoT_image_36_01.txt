1. The matrix \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 6 \) matrix, so it has 4 rows and 6 columns.  
2. The rank of \( A \) is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in its row echelon form; from the given matrix, there are 3 nonzero rows with leading entries, so \(\text{rank}(A) = 3\).  
3. The dimension of \(\text{Col }A\) (the column space) is equal to the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).  
4. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = n - \text{rank}(A)\), where \(n\) is the number of columns, so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 6 - 3 = 3\).  
5. Final answer: \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\), \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\).
