1. The set \( W \) consists of all vectors of the form \( \begin{bmatrix} 3a + b \\ 4 \\ a - 5b \end{bmatrix} \) where \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \).  
2. To determine if \( W \) is a vector space, check if it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication and contains the zero vector.  
3. The zero vector in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) is \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \); set \( 3a + b = 0 \), \( 4 = 0 \), and \( a - 5b = 0 \).  
4. The second component requires \( 4 = 0 \), which is impossible, so the zero vector is not in \( W \).  
5. Since \( W \) does not contain the zero vector, it is not a vector space.  
6. Therefore, \( W \) is not a vector space, as shown by the absence of the zero vector.
