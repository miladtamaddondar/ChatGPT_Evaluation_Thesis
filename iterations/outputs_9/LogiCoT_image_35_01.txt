1. We want to express \( p(t) = 1 + 4t + 7t^2 \) as a linear combination of the basis \( \mathcal{B} = \{1 + t^2,\, t + t^2,\, 1 + 2t + t^2\} \), so let \( p(t) = a(1 + t^2) + b(t + t^2) + c(1 + 2t + t^2) \).  
2. Expanding the right side, we get \( a(1 + t^2) + b(t + t^2) + c(1 + 2t + t^2) = a + at^2 + bt + bt^2 + c + 2ct + ct^2 \).  
3. Combine like terms: constant term: \( a + c \), \( t \) term: \( b + 2c \), \( t^2 \) term: \( a + b + c \), so \( p(t) = (a + c) + (b + 2c)t + (a + b + c)t^2 \).  
4. Set up the system by matching coefficients with \( 1 + 4t + 7t^2 \): \( a + c = 1 \), \( b + 2c = 4 \), \( a + b + c = 7 \).  
5. Solve the first equation for \( a \): \( a = 1 - c \).  
6. Substitute \( a = 1 - c \) into the third equation: \( (1 - c) + b + c = 7 \implies 1 + b = 7 \implies b = 6 \).  
7. Substitute \( b = 6 \) into the second equation: \( 6 + 2c = 4 \implies 2c = -2 \implies c = -1 \).  
8. Substitute \( c = -1 \) into \( a = 1 - c \): \( a = 1 - (-1) = 2 \).  
9. Verify by plugging \( a = 2 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = -1 \) into all original equations: \( a + c = 2 + (-1) = 1 \), \( b + 2c = 6 + 2(-1) = 4 \), \( a + b + c = 2 + 6 + (-1) = 7 \), all correct.  
10. The coordinate vector of \( p(t) \) relative to \( \mathcal{B} \) is \( \boxed{\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 6 \\ -1\end{bmatrix}} \).
