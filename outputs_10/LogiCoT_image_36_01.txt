1. Identify the size of matrix \(A\): \(A\) is a \(4 \times 6\) matrix (4 rows, 6 columns). 2. Find the rank of \(A\): The rank is the number of leading 1's (pivots) in the row-reduced form; here, there are 3 nonzero rows, so \(\text{rank}(A) = 3\). 3. Use the Rank-Nullity Theorem: \(\text{nullity}(A) = n - \text{rank}(A)\), where \(n\) is the number of columns; so \(\text{nullity}(A) = 6 - 3 = 3\). 4. State the dimension of \(\text{Col }A\): The dimension of the column space is the rank, so \(\dim(\text{Col }A) = 3\). 5. State the dimension of \(\text{Nul }A\): The dimension of the null space is the nullity, so \(\dim(\text{Nul }A) = 3\).
