1. Write the equation $T(x_1, x_2) = (-1, 4, 9)$ as a system: $x_1 - 2x_2 = -1$, $-x_1 + 3x_2 = 4$, $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 9$.
2. Form the augmented matrix for the first two equations: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & | & -1 \\ -1 & 3 & | & 4 \end{bmatrix}$.
3. Add row 1 to row 2 to eliminate $x_1$: row 2 becomes $(0, 1, 3)$, so new matrix is $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & | & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & | & 3 \end{bmatrix}$.
4. The second row gives $x_2 = 3$; this is correct since $0x_1 + 1x_2 = 3$.
5. Substitute $x_2 = 3$ into the first equation: $x_1 - 2(3) = -1 \implies x_1 - 6 = -1 \implies x_1 = 5$.
6. Verify solution in the third original equation: $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 3(5) - 2(3) = 15 - 6 = 9$, which matches the right side.
7. Final answer: $\mathbf{x} = (5, 3)$.
