1. Identify the size of matrix \( A \): \( A \) is a \( 4 \times 2 \) matrix since it has 4 rows and 2 columns.  
2. The null space of \( A \), \( \text{Nul }A \), is the set of all solutions \( \vec{x} \) to \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \), where \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \), so \( \text{Nul }A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).  
3. The column space of \( A \), \( \text{Col }A \), is the span of the columns of \( A \), which are vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), so \( \text{Col }A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).  
4. Therefore, the answers are: (a) \( k = 2 \) for \( \text{Nul }A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \); (b) \( k = 4 \) for \( \text{Col }A \) is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^4 \).
