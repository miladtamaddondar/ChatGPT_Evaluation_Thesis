1. Identify the size of matrix $A$: $A$ is a $4 \times 2$ matrix because it has 4 rows and 2 columns.  
2. The null space $\text{Nul }A$ consists of all vectors $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$, so $\text{Nul }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$; thus, $k=2$ for part (a).  
3. The column space $\text{Col }A$ consists of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$, which are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$, so $\text{Col }A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$; thus, $k=4$ for part (b).  
4. Final answers: (a) $k=2$ for $\text{Nul }A$; (b) $k=4$ for $\text{Col }A$.
